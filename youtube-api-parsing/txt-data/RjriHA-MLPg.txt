Chance about to put a hit out on Melon. Rest in peace in advance
There's no chance the rapper who made this album will ever recover
Chance just made the kidz bop version of his own songs.
Logic isn't even the best at creating the worst album.
i feel like a "strong 0" sounds so much more harsh than a "light 0".
Next album gonna open with "I'M SWEATING LIKE I'M IN A RAVE, BEEN DIVORCED FOR THREE DAYS" and get a 10/10.
I thought the album name was speeding bullet to marriage
turn that 0 upside down it’s a 0 now :)
“I love my wife”=“I’m Biracial”
Don’t worry, now he’ll drop a collab with Kanye called “Christian dudes who love their wives See Ghosts” and get a 10/10.
This is the album manifestation of that one friend who won’t shut up about how great his relationship is
"I met kanye west I am never going to fail"





And then he met his wife
“My next tour, it got eight legs like daddy long” 

He cancelled his tour today due to lack of ticket sales. Lol.
I think u need a wife to understand the genius of this album
Oh I love my wiiiiife, I love my wife, AHHH
The last verse should've been Chance apologizing for the album.
Kid Cudi (high): 0 Kid Cudi (sober): 10
Chance (married): 0
So what if Chance gets a divorce hmmm....?
Anthony I can't believe you called it better than To Pimp a Butterfly.... i have no words
"hot shower. more like hot garbage"

That could be a supa hot fire bar
Chance’s biggest mistake was dropping an album the same year as Peppa. No one can compete.
Anthony... this is just a 13 minute video of you threatening chances wife...
W H A T  T H E  H E L L  A R E  T H E S E  S I M I L E S
This is pretty much the album equivalent to a Dad Joke
Here after it was confirmed by his manager that chance half assed this
Who woulda thought we’d live in a world where Anthony Fantano would give Chance the Rapper a 0 and literally everyone is okay with it
Hedonism’s Cool, but there’s more things in life
Like getting a job 
And loving my wife
The whole album sounds like someone trying to convince there gf to buy them a ps5
"Speeding bullet to my wife"
"I now see why the album is clear, because I see right through this BS" LMFAOOOOO
His divorce album gonna be a 10/10
Husbands See Wives:  2020
Whenever I feel down, I come back to this review. The honest dissappointment in Anthony's whole appereance here kinda tells me I'm not alone in this world. Also this might be the funniest review he's ever made
someone in the comments said “give this rapper a chance” lol
You're just jealous because Kit Kats are selling better than ridge wallets.
Album so bad he’s getting sued now lol
Imagine if this video is used in court as evidence as to why the album was a flop.
“Bon Iver’s less talented cousin Don Ive’er”
André 3000 wrote a better verse about his wife in less that a minute than Chance the Rapper could in nearly an hour and a half.
“Not that I’m advocating for infidelity or cheating here...
 *BUT—* “
                  -Anthony “Melonhead” Fantano
Gives it a listen* 
“This makes Drake’s scorpion look like a masterpiece”
You’re just mad that Chance loves his wife and you don’t.
Out of context, the lyrics honestly dont sound so bad




Then you actually listen to it
Proof why being on Acid is better for your rap career than being married
finally a rap album I can listen to with my grandma... that album would be a hit in church
Chance shoulda never stopped taking drugs
Chance the Rapper?

More like Change the Diaper.
I come here every now and then to enjoy socially acceptable bullying.
"Chance is married" is the new "logic is biracial"
this is the first video that pops up after searching “chance the rapper”
gunna on drip or drown: 2/10

chance on the big day: 0/10

this confirms my theory that melon likes gunna more than chance
this review aged beautifully
LMAO, No wonder why Chance’s manager is suing him, I want my time back for this
my wife is so young my wife is so small let’s go to the beach and play with a beach ball
Honestly, all of the songs sound like they were made by Cal Chuchesta.
Just seems like this whole album is meant as a brainwashing tool for himself to actually to desperately convince himself he’s happy in this marriage
When Chance said “Obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice!
Giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake” I felt that 😔
I think we all need to take in consideration that big day is his second biggest failure his first being every freestyle he’s ever done
This is only 3 minutes shorter than The Wall. Let that sink in.
I’ve watched this review more than I have listened to the actual album.
I love my wife, I love my wife AH! let's go ride a bike, with my wife AH! 
My wife's really young my wife is really small, let's go to the beach and play with a beach ball, praise Jesus, god and my wife. Let's go to the beach and ride a bike.
(throws phone) "WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SIMILES" - Melon 2019
Chance: "I met kanye west, I'm never going to fail" 


now we know that's not true.
I honestly feel bad for chance. He even named the album "The Big Day" and everything

shoulda made a non-trash album tho
it has a 49% on google reviews


being able to get anything less than a 70% on there is a fucking miracle in mediocrity
This album makes eminem revival a masterpiece
Given the recent events with his former manager, Chance DESERVED that 0
Imagine walking into Target for a few things and seeing Anthony Fantano in the men's clothing section, inspecting the flannel shirts carefully.
I respect your opinion anthony, but the "chance the raper" joke got really unfunny after 2 times, and especially wasn't funny after you started making it an actual accusation just for a joke
“I love my wife like I am Chance”
No one:


Chance: *MUH WIFE*
*BONUS TRACK* (That Anthony ignored):

Oo,I love my wife,I love my wife
*AGH*
Let's go ride a bike,with my wife 
*AGH*
My wife's real smart,my wife's real small
Let's go to the beach and play with a beachball
Praise Jesus God and my wife
Let's go to beach and ride a bike
Chance finna release Husbands See Ghosts and get 10/10
Melon´s live reaction to this album must have been priceless.
I get that u like the album. But I think giving it a 10 was a bit much
I shuffled this album and just wanted to try listen to one song. The first line I hear is “let me tell y’all musty crustys” yeah I’m not going to try listen to the rest lmao
Mom: Where did you learn those bad words?

Also mom: 9:30
“he sounds like bon iver’s less talented cousin don iver” 💀💀💀
Chance The Rapper applied more effort lyrically to the Steven Universe: The Movie soundtrack then he did on his own studio album. And it was only for 1 song and he had Estelle, Rebecca Sugar, Aivi & Surrasshu, James Faulteroy, Macie Stewart & Julian "Zorsy" Sanchez to help him.
This is officially the first result that appears when you search for “Big Day” on YouTube
Can you imagine this review may be used as evidence in court since Chance is getting is sued.
This whole album feels like it belongs in any Adam Sandler's old shitty movies or in McDonald's Ads. Nothing feels harmonic and risk-taking its all formulaic like we've heard this already so many times.
Imagine being chance’s wife and realizing you ruined a promising rap career
When he said daddy long and threw the phone... I felt that
i loved this album too fantano. glad we finally agree on something
TURN THAT 0 UPSIDE DOWN


it’s still a 0
"Hot Shower more like Hot Garbage"



Damn chill
4:07 woah melon really does sit on a chair
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I'm bout to book a show at the dimmsdale dimmadome
the only way he can come back is if he did what kid cudi did when he got a zero. Chance has to make a collab album with childish gambino and make a 10/10 album
i wonder how melon feels when he wakes up in the morning and has to put on the red flannel
“Bon iver’s less talent cousin Don Iver” that line killed me hahaha😂
This is not a year old, no way
Chance predicted this by holding his very own  diamond encrusted ZERO on the album cover
Coming back after hearing Chance’s ex-manager is suing...never gets old 😌
Why is no one talking about “Murder Ballads” in the background? Guess we all know who Melon’s next victim is...
I swear it’s like chance’s wife forced him to make an album about her
returning ‘cause of chance’s tweet asking about the best song in the album 💀
Don’t let Logic being biracial distract you from the fact that Chance has a wife
I come back to this review every now and then just to remind myself that no matter how bad I do in life I will never be scolded as bad as this.
“I met Kanye West I’m never going to fail.”
I'm relatively new to this channel so correct me if I'm wrong, but red flannel means bad and yellow flannel means good?
Your thumbnail for this cracks me up and says it all lmao
Playboi Carti’s verse of Earfquake was better than this whole album
If KSI’s lyricism on wake up call was a whole album
He on that Humpty Dumpty flow
I come back to this video when I need a laugh
That 'Lets Argue' tweet about Chance being corny aged like fine wine
Melon: Biracial Bobby’s album is one of the worst rap albums of the year

Chance the Husband :



Hold my wife
Yoo these comments are too good 🤣🤣
Duuuuude, Chance went all Dad-jokes on this shit! I really hope that was his intention – or something....
there’s a zero on the album cover what did we expect
The albums the equivalent of the vine “she’s not just my girlfriend she’s my best friend”
Melon: “Logic has released the worst hip hop album of year”

Chance: “Hold my wedding ring”
gee anthony, no need to threaten chance’s wife and kid😬
"now I'm not advocating for infidelity or cheating, BUT-"
chance sounds like he's on a bad sugar rush
9:30 this had me weak as hell lmao
i met kanye west im never going to fail 

so that was a lie
Those 2018 singles tho... I just imagine those were his album
Chance’s next song: ‘let cal down’- he can’t believe he let cal down.
Due to the recent news about Chance disregarding his manager's advice to make this shit, this feels appropriate to come back here.
Hot shower sounds like something cal would make except cal is good
Logic: I dropped the worst rap album of                 the year

Chance the rapper: hold my wife
Y’all thought a dude who rapped “I don’t believe  in science I believe in signs” was gonna deliver y’all fire? 🤣🤣🤣 couldn’t be me.
All good, When Chance makes “My beautiful dark twisted divorce” it’s gonna get a 6/10
Nooo please dont grind your teeth down to nothing, theyre so sexy aha
Green Day has apparently joined the 0 gang
I can't believe Anthony just talked about how much he loves his wife instead of reviewing the album.
Offensive vocal performances
Bold choice, melon. You said this was better than The Money Store, To Be Kind, To Pimp A Butterfly, Kids See Ghosts, and YWGWYW combined?!
Wtf how is this album almost a year old
An album with 3mil net loss loool
They play this album in the prison to torture the prisoners
What if Chance intentionally tried to make the worst album he could make because he lost a bet to a friend?
He looks so pissed in the thumbnail
Plot twist, his manager was his ghost writer
Damn he really gave it a 0. I didn't even think that score existed anymore
this video never fails to cheer me up
Came here to celebrate the lawsuit
Kendrick ain’t black and logic bisexual wtf is happening!????
"We can't be out here pleasing everybody"
Logic- Did you know I’m biracial?

Chance the Rapper- No, but did you know that I love my wife?
This album is deadass what happens if Tom DeLonge decided to start a rap career
11:30 Anthony should release a rap album roasting rap albums 😂😂
This shows why you should always stay true to yourself. Chance is trying too hard to be Kanye but it clearly does not work.
This is one of the few times where he is pissed that someone who had so much potential squandered it.
imagining your debut album got a 0/10
Crazy that this is the exact video that destroyed Chance The Rappers Career
Currently there is one of those rusty knife restoration videos in this album’s playlist on Chance’s YouTube channel. Go check it out.
Anthony you made a lot of great points just be sure to take the whole "I finna have an affair with Chance's wife" thing down a few notches.
5:40 me when I don’t understand the similes
This album sounds like Chance went on YouTube and typed in Chance the Rapper type beats
12:45

Is that the cover of "Bottomless Pit" with Peppa Pig?
i still haven’t listened to this lmao i’m scared
I know Anthony gave this album a 0 but I haven’t seen this video yet and I’ve never seen him give something that low (NOT GOODs excluded) ever so I’m really wondering how hard he goes with this.

Edit: WOW
i think he’ll give “Good Ass Job” a 10
Chance will drop a classic if he ever gets a divorce
So...this Album is not quite as good as "to pimp a butterfly" is it?
Okay we get it Anthony but saying his feature with Ed Sheeran is the new Straight Outta Compton sounds a little too extreme
I wish I could get alerts for only new not good and 0/10 album reviews
4:08 did it take anyone else until they saw this part to realize that Anthony is always sitting in his videos?
Chance’s breakup album: Speeding Bullet 2 My Wife
CHANCE REALLY PUT "DIMSDALE DIMMIDOME" IN HIS FUCKING ALBUM!?!??!?!?!? Holy shit, he is never recovering. I don't care if he makes the cure to every single terminal illness.
Why u never wear the infinity flannel 😭
"I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail" - The actual definition of Famous Last Words
Come back a year later just for a laugh honestly
Prepare for a mindblowing Kanye collab called "Children Observe Phantoms" that'll get a 10
Nah fam this album is garbage but don’t diss my man smino
UUUOOOOWWW CHANCE DOESN’T KNOW WHO DIDDY KONG IS
Had to revisit this after the allegations from his manager.  This mess makes sense now.
Then we have "hot shower" MORE LIKE HOT GARBAGE 😂😂😂
Speeding Bullet to Heaven: 0 
KSG: 10

Next Chance album a 10???
Yeah, Chance fan here... This album is bad- in every way. Continue with your regularly scheduled programming...
I haven't listened to the album nor will I. I genuinely cannot tell if some of the lyrics I see in the comments are serious or memes
Atleast it wasnt a light 0.
It fails spectacularly as an album, sure. But as a kit-kat advertisement? At least a 7.
more like the big gay
"Dad Trap"
i keep revisiting this video because it always makes my day
and not in the way the album came, thank god
'More like Hot garbage!' I'm dead💀 Why you gotta do Chance like that?
I've never seen Anthony look so disgusted by something in his thumbnails ever before
i come back to this video to laugh
Chance the rapper and Logic are the Adam Sandler of the hip hop and rap industry.
Chance the Rapper is the worst rapper ever don’t @ me
Somebody said Chance make music for youth pastors who sit on their chairs backwards. 😂😂😂
this is the best review ever. Made my day. the best moment on the entire album was Nicki Minaj's verse on the final track, "Zanies & Fools."
By far the funniest review hes ever done lmao
still don’t know if this album was some kind of elaborate joke
“I’m bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome”


Never in my life did I think Chance the rapper, or anyone for that matter, would say something like this on a song. Ever. But here we are.
Turn that 0 sideways, now it's a thicc 0.
Imo, this album includes some of chances best work to date, this is the next Blonde, from elusive, trap bangers such as Ballin Flossing, to lyrical, Kendrick like abilities showcased in Hot Shower, this album is a strong 8 to a light 9 you can really see his Death Grips influences!
I come back to this video once a month. Seeing Melon tear this album apart piece by piece is the only spec of appreciation I have for this “album”, because without it he wouldn’t be able to do so
im back for my viewing of the day
5:11 is fucking hilarious
_If your album gets a 0 you instantly go to the shadow realm._
Chance the Rapper in 3019: The Big End
The moment when you realize the CALssic has a better rating than your Song
I love my life with my wife, she protects me from the strife
This album is literally the equivalent of that Lost in Space movie scene where a guy goes, "I love you, Wife."
melon, saying Kiki do you love me for 13 minutes is not a proper review, other than that, satisfied
"there's also the sudden peanut butter jelly time references on the track ballin and flossin"


i had to take a moment
twenty/twenty, twenty/twenty vision, i see you, 2020 i'ma try and be around you-chance the rapper (2019)

now i see why this year was a trainwreck! chance the rapper jinxed it in this terrible album!
Here in 2020 just to confirm Chance still hasn’t recovered .
bro just give him a chance
"22 track torture chamber" 💀
Coming back to these reviews after the recent allegations from his old manager, learning that Chance threw Big Day together in less than 6 months REALLY makes sense.
Didn’t knew logic did album reviews.
"I met Kanye West im never gonna fail"  "Kanye's best prodigy"...

Say sike right now
I come back to this review when I'm down to laugh and gain perspective realizing I could be at another level of low
Anyone else here after watching the Greenday review?
This album was so bad it made Anthony revisit his speedin’ bullet 2 heaven score multiple times and found things to praise in it compared to this
‘i met my wife, i’m going to fail’
Logic: did u know I'm biracial
Chance: that's cool but did u know I'M MARRIED??
4:26 It’s not very polite to strangle your snake during the review, Melon
Above all, labeling Chance as a Kit-Kat sales rep was the hottest roast
4:07 cursed moments throughout history
If Cal Chuchesta collabed with eminem, london yellow on hot shower, It would be way way more hundred times better than the original hot shower song honestly.
Wow...a 0

Can’t even give him a Chance.

As a rapper.
when he said "i love my wife", i felt that
Now that Melon officially gave him a 0, when's The Big Funeral?
its so crazy that you can type in a song name that has been reviewed, then type melon, and itll come up
When he said 
"Dynamite blew up the school
Now we're talking really cool"
I felt that
In conclusion; Chance can only make a good project when he’s showing his face in the album cover.
Can’t we agree on how melon reviewed this really well, and highlighted the issues in a humoristic manner
The review that made Chance birthed his signature quote "I love my wife."
Lmao "Don Iver"
It was average, i dont think its that bad, but it wasnt as good as his old albums
He’s going to make a collab album with Kanye in 3 years and you will give it a 10
0/10 is generous
Waiting for 2022’s “The Big Divorce”
By the way you cant critisize his album on his insta because he'll block you.
That flu shot line is hitting different now
"Anthony Fantano has rated this album a 0/10, stating that the album is 'very poorly written' and 'has the big gay'" -The Wikipedia page for this album, circa 7 minutes ago.
I come here every so often so I can laugh
That album cover should be the thumbnail for every trash record moving forward
A infinite flannel would be perfect for a 5/10
Anthony "Thumbnail-face-says-it-all" Melon
“I met Kanye West I’m never going to fail!” 

THE BIG DAY- 0/10
so true could not get through one song of this. And, I have been a stan saw him during the acid rap era. frickn sad
"I met kanye west im never going to fail"
they had us at first not gonna lie
It really is bad, idk what he was shooting here for. This the logic of albums:)
Never would've guessed Logic would review a Chance album
Chance The Rapper: The Big 0
someone needs to put fantano reading hot shower lyrics on tick tok lol
This has the best thumbnail description for any review he's done 😂
BRUH he’s got a red flannel on RIP Chance the rapper may he Rest In Peace ❤️
Yea I’m definitely gonna ‘remember’ the big day alright
chance the rapper more like chance the crapper
At least this album ain't Father of All...
I LOVE MY WIFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeee
i want an infinity flannel
Back watching this after Chance is being sued for this garbage album
when anthony does not like an album, i know i'll enjoy it
“We can’t be out here pleasing everybody”
wow anthony you didn’t have to refer to him as “Chance The Crapper”
hot shower is lowkey good id give this a 1/10
To be fair, Speedin' Bullet to Heaven was better...
I can't believe the album cover predicted the score you'd give
Chance needs to go back to smoking cigarettes and doing acid
"Chance is religious"
"Chance has a kid"
"Chance is married" 
The entire album summed up
Murder Ballads is a wonderful album. Stagger Lee!
Album so bad he had to cancel his tour
i was so disappointed with the album :( ALL THAT THEME isnt on it
Man I do agree with the album rating but I think Melon calling Chance the n word 19 times went a little too far
Logic: I’m b-
Chance: I LOVE MY WIFE!
The dude says "my wife" more than Borat.
Life's as short as a midget and mine's a little lebron🥺
Ngl Chance has some of the best Hip Hop flows
I new that n/a was going to be a good one
you know the album is bad when melon is reading the lyrics aloud
When this dropped there were mad dislikes
12:25
What your looking for
I love chance but I was sooo disappointed with this album
5:12 that's how you know you've made it
Waiting for Chance’s album with Kanye to get a 10
Now I can finally understand the Beyond The Golden Arches reference.
Go look at the wikipedia page for this album right now. The first sentence says "The Big Day is an embarrassment to art, released on July 26, 2019."


If it's not there anymore, check the edit history.
Chance approached this album the same way a Junior approaches an essay for english class, he simply does the whole thing in one night and turns it in the next day, praying for a good grade.
Kanye, you got new job. First was to rescue Cudi, now you must do the same with Chance.
At least his prices for features should go down. I’ll have to help him make a come back 🙏🏽
is this what people named something like Joe feel like all the time
I understand that you dont like the album but you didnt hsve to say you wanna beat him to death with a dinosaur bone. Jeez
"My next tour, it got eight legs like daddy long"
Not even the entirety of Asura's Wrath could compare to the transcendent fury that rose inside me upon hearing that bar.
You know who did love the album?
*H I S  W I F E*
By far my favorite review
Would love to hear Fantano explain to me why my music sucks someday
Thats what y’all get for bugging him endlessly
5:34 I heard his wife
Now I can only focus on your breathing lol
The moment when you realize the CALssic has a better rating than your Song
I remember looking at the red flannel and hearing the kit kat jab at the beginning and thinking “damn it’s over”.
"I need stock and it gotta be pippi long" I'm crying 😂😂😂
He didn’t make it a “NOT GOOD” because melon knows his power of marking a rapper for death
good video for the most part but the whole “hitler was a good man” thing kinda turned me off
Man, I can’t find one Portishead review. Wtf, Anthony
22 TRACK WOUNDS...DIDNT WANNA LEAVE HIM A CHANCE?! HUH..HE WAS BLEEDING, HE WAS BEGGING YOU FOR MERCY AND YOU STABBED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
Kmsl needle drop hilarious man 😂😂😂😂
You're just mad 'cuz you can't book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome.
But chance met Kanye, he ain’t ever gon fail. Awful review melon.
I personally love “do you remember”
“2020 ima try and be around you” he had no idea
still waiting on you to wear the infinity flannel
Melon: 0/10 Worst album 


Chance: Wife, I want a divorce.
5:36 - Kills me everytime.
Don Iver sent me 😂
The harrassment starts from here 1:42
😂 Damn Melon has never even even gone this hard on Nav.
That Cover art was Just Chance presenting the 0 out of 10.
Congrats Anthony, you've gained an over 1 million views.
Oh my God a strong ZERO  😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
That 'Don Iver' joke got me
"I now see why this album, on the cover, is clear--because I see right through this BS." 
_APEXKEK, MELON DESTROYING THIS MAN_
Logic's kryptonite: Race
Chance's kryptonite: Marriage
Speedin Bullet 2 zero
"Na na nyah nyah nyah, na na nyah nyah nyah"

- Chance the Rapper, every album of every song ever
I love watching this review when I feel sad
5:36 i cracked up
“I love my wife, yeah I love my wife” -Chancelor Bennett
what is weird. those few tracks he put out last year... were reallly good. I might need security, Wala cam, Work out... those were nice and his flow... idk what he was thinking. disappointing. think this is a bit harsh, but i wasnt really into it. he has always had a sonically pleasing sound, even if his content wasnt exactly there. this time he missed on the things he was good at.
Yeah Anthony, this really was album of the year.
These the worst bars I ever heard
damn melon ,you didnt have to call him a  cheating n word
Is ok, Chance will make a gospel album with Kanye and it will get a 10
Me when I saw this come out: cool! wonder what he gives it.
Me after I saw the rating: *searches if Chance is still alive*
Green day got a 0 too!
5:20 i can’t stop laughing I’m dead 💀
XXXTENTACION > Chance the Rapper

**The MELON has SPOKEN.**
damn I love seeing Fantano rip into a bad record
I'm not going to lie. This review had me dying of laughter! 🤣
as soon as i saw the red flannel, i knew this album was getting a 0-3
A strong zero😂😂😂😂
Anthony I just listened to this entire album, I think your rating of a strong zero is far too generous.
When chance said “peanut butter jelly and a baseball bat” I felt that 😔😔
HOLY SHIT THAT MULTI FLANNEL!!!!!!! what a find
my wife is my queen, ooh
ow ouch owie my spleen, ooh
I love my wiiiife, i love my wife UH , Ride a bike with my wife Uh
me in my head the whole time, " its a vibe its a vibe"
Holding his own 0 on the cover lmaooo
He’s not sad he’s just dissapointed
It's a strong 0 because you need to drink a Strong Zero to get through the fucking album.
The bonus track "I Love My Wife" was pretty good though
The beat on slide around is 🔥🔥🔥
Watch this album become Grammy-nominated
Bruh I really watched this video twice just to figure out the out of hand jokes people are mentioning in the comments then I realized 🤦🏽‍♂️
Maybe check out NF's album. It outsold Chance's for #1 of the week...
5:39 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he threw something. hahahaha.
It really broke my heart to see that Dorito commercial. I knew it was a wrap after that. Only Wiz Khalifa selling oreos could be more corny.
The church youth pastor be bustin moves to this album
I feel like garbage this video was posted on my birthday
I dont know the album is like his other projects. The first 2 songs are real good
I only listened to like 10 minutes of the album,  but i come back to listen to you trash if over and over again <3
"I met Kanye West I am never going to fail"
It really was downhill after that.
"I'm half wife"
*-chance the rapper*
This is my favourite YouTube video.
Great review melon, but I thought it was kind of weird when you started talking about how Chance used to let you shit in his mouth
Who’s here after Melon roasted the shit out of Green Day’s new album?
y'all got juked this was actually a kidz bop rebrand
"He sounds like Bon Iver's less talented cousin Don Yver"


...goddamn Anthony
Hot Shower is severely underrated
J
F**king hell, I will never be able to listen to "Yeah" the same way again...
This was on my recommended after "How Artists Should Deal With Failure". Welp, it wasn't wrong.
After hearing Smino's 'Donny Outthaway' I'm surprised to hear anyone say Smino sounds comatose but maybe he improved since then idk
Melon you’re just mad you can’t book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I’m disappointed that Anthony hasn’t worn the Infinity Flannel yet. Maybe one day......
If only he would've made another Acip Rap, that was his prime imo
8:18 Chance predicts Logic’s No Pressure which got a good review. So a line on COADM/Supermarket will predict Chance’s next 7/10 album
I LOVEEE MY WIIIFFEEE
but the three damn grammys line is fire
Chance has become the corny dad of rap
Fantano wasn't invented to Chance's wedding so he got revenge on him
*B I R D M A N  H A N D R U B*
“I met Kanye West, I’m never gonna fail” 😬
fam why is everybody hating?? I love the album 4 real
I’ve watched this review more than any other reviews in the history of music
6:49 thank you
We still can't believe you gave a "not good" to Post Malone's debut, Melon. Never forget.
The title of this album sounds like something I would use in 2nd grade when writing about a kickball game I had at recess
Its crazy that some people actually enjoyed this record.
1:47 - 'The Big Day is essentially a 22 track torture chamber'. Just the way he says it makes me die every time lol.
Mine's a little lebron ???
👀
Sad cause I love Chance .. but this is acc accurate 😞
Chance The Rapper: 

Anthony: imma destroy this man’s whole marriage
It’s almost confusing because I really liked that four song EP he released right before
Wow cal got you that flannel with his allowance and you didn’t even wear it once
Hands up if you come back to this review almost everyday cuz it’s Fantano’s greatest review of all time.
praise *jesusgod* and *MY WIFE!*
Ooo I love my wife, AH
Let’s go ride a bike, AH
Melon couldn’t give the album a NOT GOOD becuz this album was BAD
Ilovethany Mywifetano
You can't give him a 0/10 because his hat
Tell us how you really feel, wow.
Saw through dude, too much suburban love when he came out.
I think the flannel looks pretty cool cal, don't listen to the melon he's crazy
This may be my favorite review, I've watched it like 5 time
What happened to your ring fantano?
Confirmed. Chance is going to come out with a joint album with another artist under a new name and receive a 10.
"Found a good one(single no more)"
"we cant be out here pleasing everybody"
*just keep your eyes on the point where his glasses meet his nose*
The album cover shows a disc with good songs from the album
You’re gonna be hearing from Chance soon, he’s gonna be trying to get this taken down lol
Cal's gonna use the Infinity Flannel to snap away Iggy Azalea's husband
the big day became the sad day
"beloved"
sigh....
Whoa! Thats even worse than Revival
Lmao he put "n/a" under fav tracks in the description.
i love the phrase “ 22 track torture chamber “ lmfoaoo
If More Life is "Filler The Album" then The Big Day is "I Love My Wife The Album"
Although his name is Chance the Rapper, I’ve never heard him rap🤓
Hop on that NF album
He made music you listen to when you're washing the car with your dad.
I liked the track with his brother and that one with Francis Starlite.
*slams phone*

WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SIMILIES?!
Logic would be proud
Hot shower 🤦🏽‍♂️
Chance should do acid again
Best way to listen to this album is to listen to his 10 day album instead
We need an extended cut
I just picked up an infinity flannel at Burlington Coat Factory for $4.99
HOT HOT 
Jumpin out the grease!
I wanna see him dump out a zero
How much y’all wanna bet in the future, Chance the Rapper will release a phenomenal album and Melon is going to give it a 10!
Man watching this after the wordless version is so fun. 
"OH MAN HE DID THE THING WHERE HE BREATHES IN AND SLAPS HIS FACE"
the "My next tour gonna have eight legs like daddy long" line hits harder now
Bet Chance and ma man Logic are gonna kill on they're upcoming project Biracial Wives tho. 10/10
First time I comment your review "melon", after giving that record a listen, I went to your review to look for your fav tracks and... nothing...
I think you're tough on "sun come down" and "we go high" but I never pay attention to the lyrics co i'm a french speaking fre@k.
This album is too Pippi long...
"my wife allalalalallal wife my wife wifew lalalalwalalalalk lalal i love me wifey lalalalalalalalal ahahala,alalal my wifeeeeeeeeeee i love me wiiiiiiffffffffe lalalalalaLA"


my fav bar of the entire record
I watch this probably once a week
But did he listen to the bonus track "I love my wife"?
OOOOH I LOVE MY WIIIIIIIIFE I LOVE MY WIFE
90% of the time I agree with this man , and I agree again on this one chief love the channel bro
I now know why he has an otterbox case on his phone. 🤣
Surprised it’s not a “not good”
I thought the 0 was a meme. Wow
5:39 absolute favorite part
Chance my dude & I’ve been riding w/ him from day one..... but this album was bad. Musically, it had no coherence whatsoever. I kept waiting for a song that I could ride to, but..... Damn, Chano. You made me agree w/ this dude.
I love my wife ahhhhhhh
Man I thought my music sucked lmfao but after this album I feel great about my music 💀😂
So basically, he cheated on his wife and she said she'd leave him if he didnt make an album about her in a month
I’m just glad that, as a community, we hold our artists accountable. There is a difference between a one-off album, and a fucking disgraceful lazy bad album!
This is gonna go down as one of his funniest reviews s2g
damn i didn’t like the album but you’re on straight trash 😭
Anthony you should review Surf by Chance and the Social Experiment
2 Kanye protégés now have 0’s lmaoo
Next Album ain't gonna be 
"I love my wife!"
But
"I hate my wife!"
Or
"I left my wife!"
"I can see through this BS" 😂😂😂😂
This review pleased me, exactly what I was thinking eugh so bad
Chance really hasn't taken to the criticism well either. Lets hope his next one is better than this abomination
Initially I thought Anthony was being harsh, but by the lyrical breakdown he had me convinced.
12:12 is how people sound when trying to defend this album 😂
i came here solely for 6:49
I'm a big Chance fan, but I honestly did not enjoy a single song on this album.
5:40 I bet he didn't even throw his phone, probably threw his ridge wallet instead 😂
Speeding bullet to my wife, that I love, I have a wife
i feel like when chance the rapper disrespects his fans, his fans watch this video to laugh and open their eyes on who chance the rapper really is
10 day 8
Acid rap 9
Coloring book 7
The big day 5
This new Chance the Rapper album... it’s not good.
*BOOM*
Dimmsdale line was fire 🔥
Total Xanarchy was higher than this? That's a low blow
I taught hot shower was good haha
When I heard "I've got plans to hug and hug and hug you" I swear I thought I was listening to kidz bop 39.  What trash, absolute trash.  I loved 10 day, acid rap, and coloring book and I cannot believe that chance thought this album was ready to be released.
Those bars could work 





If it was ski másk the slump god rapping them
I’m still mad about how bad this album is
"a 22 track torture chamber"
Jesus Christ Anthony....
Ok but the song “get a bag” is good. That’s all I’ll say.
i laughed at the hot garbage joke
I was so disappointed when I heard this album
The title track was actually good aside from his weird freak out part
Ouuu I love my wife I love my wife
I love this album glad I listened to it first before this review. I could have missed out.
The song with MadeinTYO and Dababy was kinda nice ngl
0:14 this noise is in all of his reviews but why is it there?
Thanks melon for confirming my opinion that I hate this
my by straight up threw his phone on the floor
Nice turn of events to see you give the album a zero because it’s just genuinely not good rather than because the artist is black
Oh no, the RED FLANNEL!  Go get em Melon!
I havent listened to the album but during  this review it dawned on me that its gotta be a must listen so bad that its just bad
omg the first zero since sb2h..
And i thought he was hard on Logic but god damn
Tbh I liked Roo though....
It had decent bars, and a great featured verse by his brother.
I prefer speeding bullet to heaven
my fave was We Go High
- Fails as a collective project
- No Justin Bieber
- 3 year gap
- No Gambino
Conspiracy theory time

Young chance wants to be famous as a young kid, releases mixtapes
Chance gets big
Women start throwing themselves at him
He resists but only for so long as he keeps dropping work
Finally gives in
Feels awful
Stops working on music
Does ads just to distance himself from the fame but still has critics begging for more
Decides to bomb career so he can drop out of the spotlight forever 
Goes back to his wife
Does General Insurance ads with Shaq to keep generating money
Anyone know where I can buy the Infinity Flannel??
this video put everything single feeling and thought i had about this album and put it into words
I’m so glad I didn’t buy it
NEW LITTLE BROTHER ANTHONY
The cover art may be the worst thing about this album
Chance gets a not good....
Hopefully, this wasn't his last album
I don’t even want to listen to the album and be disappointed 😞
This might be a stretch...

But I think Chance is married.
Poor chance. Got married to get on another album, got excluded from the album, made an album about the wedding, and everyone  hates the album.
I personally really liked hot shower, mostly because of DaBaby because madeinTyo is hot garbage and Chance is decent
I love my wife
Marriage - STRONG 0
Minimalist wallet salesman takes on arch nemesis Kit Kat salesman in scathing attack
Don Iver
I think Anthony just mad that he had the audacity to put death cab on the album
22 track torture chamber.
I LOVE MY WIFE, AHH
Wow, first 11/10? I thought red flannel was for bad albums only but ok.
Fantano's Coach Z impression is pretty good.
How you gonna turn down the INFINITY FLANNEL? Bro you worked so hard for that!
Shittin on all those shitty albums... you're real jerk buddy...
hot damn anthony good review
Oh man, just noticed Melon has Metal Box in the corner. Legend.
Petition to have Anthony wear the infinity flannel whenever he gives a 5/10
You just don't love your wife, melon.
Here in 2020 saying the album still trash. Sorry chance
That Le Bron line didnt age well....
diddy kong is actually 7’10 on google
Jesus even Logic hasn't had a zero before 😬
At 4:07 u can hear his Chair Squeak... exposed
Mixtape Chance >>> Album Chance confirmed
Greens lol
this album really got ppl hoping for Chance to get a divorce 💀💀💀 ik it's a joke but still
Rumor has it this album syncs up perfectly with the movie Grown Ups
I liked the album. I have no good arguments or evidence for my case, i just have fun listening to it.
Thumbnail kinda looks like DAMN.
My favorite review from u ❤️
imagine your husband makes you an album and it sounds like liquid shit
Is there literally anyone who thinks this isn't the absolute best review he ever put out, bar maybe speeding bullet 2 heaven?
Anthony went Ivan Drago on this album!
the thumbnail says it all 😂😂😂
How did you listen to the whole thing?
You laugh now, but Chance is gonna pull a Cudi, make a divorce album with Ye and get a 10/10
It's chance's worst album in my opinion, but a 0 is way too low. There were some good songs on the album like Do You Remember for example.
I disagree! I love the album
I wanna see kamikaze 2 by chance the rapper
“why do worms prefer habitats”
Wow Anthony, you didn't have to say that his wife was a 0/10 too.
I liked the Nanny bar 😂😂😂 but the album was bad. I thought that Chance’s first album was going to be somewhat disappointing, but holy fuck i didn’t think it would be this bad......
Is that just a cutout section of green screen clipped to the wall that he puts the cover on?
I love this review
7:20 clip it and ship it boys
Sees flannel: well at least it’s not a “NOT GOOD” review

Looks at score: JESUS CHRIST IT MIGHT AS WELL BE!!!!
mehhh i’m a melon mehh
who else came to see him say “hot shower? more like hot garbage”
This album is trash, but I will defend his line “fuck goin straight to the pro’s I’m professor” the delivery is trash, but he’s referring to the famous streetballer “The Professor” who never went to the NBA
Wifeee
Chance was holding the album score on the cover, what did you guys expect???
Chance has been on the decline since acid rap
Chance aka Kit Kit Salesman aka Dorito Man
The best divorce album ever
Why im enjoying this album so much
Guess you can say today is





THE BIG DAY
Track review on I love my wife by chance the rapper pls
I was so uninterested in the album that I couldn’t finish it. Likewise with this video! Thank you Cramthony Badthano subscribed
wow i cant belive melon just told me to cheat on my wife thanks melon
Fantano's underbite going haaaaard this review.
Me in 2015: hahaha this chance guy is cool he’s got some bars

Chance the Rapper in 2019: 
D I M M S D A L E D I M M A D O M E
My friends keep playing hot shower and at first I didn’t know it was chance and I was like “why are you guys listening to this?” But then I found this review and like finally someone else who thinks that song is hot garbage. Haven’t listened to the rest of the album and I’m not going to cuz I can imagine all the songs being just as bad.
I still can’t believe how disappointing this album was
Do you remember, best song ever

Change my mind.
i knew from the cover it was gon be bad,but wow
Logic - "My mom is white, dad was black, so I'm biracial. I also from Maryland. Oh and I'm biracial."
Chance The Rapper - "Naw bro, I have a wife, unlike you. I love my wife."
DAMN GINA
do u use shampoo with your Hot Shower?
I love returning to this to see Melon dunk on Chance, who despite the praise at the start is as shitty and wanky as Drake and Logic.
Stay away from me I'm not ur girlfriend or wife
I'm alive for the second 0 i cant believe it I'm literally shaking and crying rn
11:30 sickthony burntano here
Me and my brother listened to this album and we had to listen to something else every 3 songs because it was so boring
Somehow you rated this lower than speeding bullet to heaven
Oh shit, he genuinely mad here
Chance is gonna renounce his religion after this review, which was probably Atheistano’s plan
A perfect example of the Best New Artist curse
when you get the baby you didn't adopt (idek) 1:42
Looking back on this, the album sucks but hot shower is a really funny song in that the jokes are so bad that they become all the way back to funny
I wonder what a ski mask, anderson paak and chance the rapper collab would sound like. Like a good one.
"I now see why the [disc on the album] is clear, because I see right through this BS" 

Holy shit, dude.
Don Iver 🤣🤣😭😭
I liked the album but I definitely didn’t think it was perfect
You can always tell what he thinks about the album by his expression on the thumbnail.
Please review new Little Brother 🙏🏻❤️
Kanye West record deal:
-Great Debut Project
-Have successful follow ups
-Absolute trash album
-Collab album with Kanye for redemption.
If Anthony fantano said no, it’s not 🤷🏾‍♂️
I would literally rather not listen to music at work if this was the only thing to listen to
12:23
Hot garbage😂😂😂
Cudi = 0
Cudi w/ Ye = 10

So are we expecting a 10 from Chance and Ye's collab album, melon?
In a few years chance is going to be chance the father
I just came back to this review and I swear the dislikes were 50/50 the first day. Now people have listened to the album and realized that....Fantano was right.
Dimmodome Dimmadome???😂
Anthony should have rated this as a "broken a marriage / 10"
"I would rather listen to Nicki on this beat" oh man it's over
Never liked his music altogether.
It wasn't until this video I realized which side of the room Cal was on and that I had it backwards all this time.
and hot shower has 119 311 471 listens on spotify smh
Anthony "advocate for infidelity and cheating" Fantano
You can’t just give him a 10/10 just because you like KitKats
Melon displeased , melon real displeased 😠 🍉
Literally ruined his own career from one tape
Wow didn’t expect chance to beat Kendrick with best rap album of the decade. It definitely deserved that strong 10 to a light 11
1 year later, and this album is still trash.
calling it now: chance will pull a cudi by making an album that melon gives a 0, then makes an album with kanye that gets a 10
RIP Chance I’m calling it now
Waiting for the day the infinity flannel gets put on
You should review the album Sad, Fat Luck by Ceschi. I can't stop listening to it
the big gay
I bet Jimmy Fallon is bumping his preordered album everyday thinking is a 10.
The scary part is that a chance and Kanye collaboration is a very possible thing and might have another kids see ghosts with someone who got a zero with Kanye
His face on the thumbnail describes this album
Kids see chance 10/10 you heard it here first
eternal was good
Chance: "I love my wife"
Melon: Gives 0/10
Hearing "Gish Gallop" in a music review about a christian artist is... Unexpected, but funny lol
not even handsome? that shit hits
Some of those lyrics; Yikes!
ooo i love my wife i love my wife EH
This is J. Coles “Folding Clothes,” the album
When you get married, god takes away your ability to rap
I had to stop watching when he said madeinTYO did better in hot shower

I was with him until that point too
Negative xp > fantano
LOL! Awesome!
Usually a 0/10 is a not good. You know you're just a damn clown when you get a 0/10.
Lmfao The skit at the end is mad funny
I honestly liked this album.
Review Appolo G from Portugal men!
Who’s here after the news that Chance’s old manager is suing him over this album sucking so bad 😂
Melon: Gives 0/10

Chance: Wife, I don't feel so good AH!
5:36
I can’t believe it’s called THE BIG DAY. Jokes.
Bro. Are you sitting or standing??
And the god make us booyah in the context of multiple cartoon references is a Teen Titans reference. I laughed when I heard it.

Meanwhile he gives a favorable review to Meggan the stallion who is just talking about getting her cheeks ate in song after song.
Next album: Single again
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Coronavirus coming
Ok but that daddy long bar is kinda fire
Wikipedia currently calls this album, “The Big Gay”.
this is why he should stick to mixtapes
Yo the pic of this video looks like







I am disgusted
The Big Poo Poo Pee Pee Moment by Chance the Man
Bad cover = bad album
I want to know what a light zero sounds like.
It's okay. Chance is going to release a collaborative album with Kanye and get a 10
This is legit the ultimate blow to Chance's career.
Tbh. I do really like zanies and fools
Vic Mensa And Chance The Rapper: The Most Disappointing Children Of Chicago
Is his first name seriously Chancellor?
"He knows Diddy is the small one right?" 

Bwwwwwahahahahahahaha
Happy you didn't mention big fish cause I like that Gucci feature and chance I think does pretty well with that beat too
Lovethony Wifetano
It’s weird seeing this channel with over 2 million subscribers. In like 2013, he did a collab with cartoon block and his channel was so small
AllMusic rating : 4/5 bruhh
Praise Jesus, god, and my wife
Now I'm just waiting for a Chance and Kanye collab
this boi said don iver im dead
Maybe Chance had a writer working for him who quit recently? Only explanation, imo
He's already making dad jokes and now hes making the dad joke album
Imagine a review on your album getting more views than your actual album LMAOOO
That professor line was a reference to The Professor street ball player I think
I get what you mean, but plenty of others rap like this as well.
This age well
A 22 track torture chamber
- Melon
I love my wiiiiiiiife, ooh i love my wife (ah!)
He’s like logic now wtf lol
If this was death grips you would have given it a 10/10
Green day
Dude, 


have some respect for the dead.
YBN Cordae actually out here making a better Chance The Rapper album than Chance did
Hot shower= If you can say bat you can say hat 


It’s nonsense and words and sayings that have nothing to do with each other
You’ve never heard acid rap?
Hot Garbage is unironically the only track I enjoyed off the album. Shits an absolute bop if you turn your brain off 🤷‍♂️
WERE YOU SITTING ON A CHAIR ALL THIS TIME ?!
Lets Agree 

Chance The Rapper's first actual debut album is Coloring Book rather than The Big Day
Luciky ,this album didnt gave a *NOT GOOD* because Melon gave it a *Chance* to spare his life.
He does love his wife tho
I found it a thoroughly immature record. And not to mention the production on The Big Gay is pretty low effort. Overall, not a fan.
Great Album.
so much negativity i got to go watch kids see ghost review now
5:39
Chance released an album full of Dad bars. Hip-Hop will never accept Dad/Husband rap!
Does any1 else hear a msg tone
Chance dropping a 10/10 in 2022 watch out boys
at least Acid Rap will get album of the year on Spotify
6:49
I really dont understand how this is a 0
Not surprised it's crap after hearing him on Cross Me with Ed Sheeran
Album wasn’t great but we so high was real nice
Someone said, “the album is for guys who get proposed to” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cal worked really hard to make that flannel Anthony.
🤣🤣🤣
Cal and anthony are such good friends they bought matching friendship rings
Melon's wearing his red and blue checkered flannel. Somebody's getting destroyed 😂😂😂
“22 track torture chamber” Jesus Christ😂
XDDDD
ufff this review is like a stab in the kidney for chance the rapper
Anthony this is iconic.
hip hop 2019
Cordae watching this rubbing his hands like bird man
i hate when im starting to enjoy an album but then fantano roasts it and i cant enjoy it no more
Hi everyone,
Lovemythony Wifetano
Here
chance the fapper original funny ifunny
send tweet
HOLY SHIT. Through all the years I’ve been watching you on YT I’ve never seen you do a 0. 

I’m sure you have, but I’ve never seen it.
Imagine being that big just to have YBN Cordae AND Rich Brian drop better albums than you on the same day
He should just get back with Kirk Franklin. Coloring book was 🔥
You're still wrong Anthony
Damn
you were so enthousiat this time
"Hot lanta smoking green, cauliflower"
Acid rap chance is dead.
Melon would you rather listen to Speeding Bullet to Heaven on repeat or this?
They should call it “the shitty day”
Yep this album was trash
Death Pig, or Peppa Grips? The ultimate question.
Logic releases an album - it sucks
Chance the Rapper releases an album - it sucks
Therefore, Logic is biracial.
5 year plan was the best on this
I hope he saw this
I’m writing an entire script on this video, so wish me luck, cuz it’s gonna take a LONG time.
Edit: never mind, I’ve given up on it lol
He peaked in that doritos commercial
*Sees Chance The Rapper Gets A Red Flannel*
Oh shit
*Sees the score*
OH SHIIIIIIIIIIIITTTT!!!!!!!!!
This was painful to watch.
Someone give chance some tabs hot shower was buns
11/10 on the slam poetry
yes, i agree on every single thing.
eternal and all day long are good songs you cant change my mind
11:30
I'm surprised he didn't give a not good to to the title
Chance makes wales  recent statement seem somewhat true
This shit sounds like the Proud Family soundtrack.
What is a glizzey?
Did Chance fire his ghostwriter? I contes doesn't sound like the same person.
the big gay
I couldn’t even finish the album
Nobody:
Chance:






Are you aware of my 
s i g n i f i c a n t        o t h e r
That Nick Cave Murder Ballads in the back is a fire record
The face of a disappointed father.mp4
12:34
I really hate the album artwork
Jaden Smith: Hey chance, can you make an album that makes me look good in comparison?

Chance: I gotchu fam
Couldnt agree more. Album was such a let down
Mac-le-more
I love my wife
This album didn’t go very well but I hope he can recover because he has a lot of raw talent and energy. I think he needs to get a label because I think he’s gotten to a point where he wants to do a lot of stuff and has a lot of ideas but it’s difficult for him to do this without having the recourses and people that you would have if he had a label.
December 25,2019-Chance the Rapper releases an album featuring Swans, Death Grips, Kendrick Lamar, Sun Kil-Moon and Cal Chuchesta and pulls a Kid Cudi 2.0 by getting the first 11/10
Slide around though lol
Also Doritos sales rep
12:34
12:34
Speedin bullet = 0 
Kudi: *makes collab album with Kanye and gets a 10*

Big Day = 0
Chance: Ahaha
Lol Anthony Fantano gave him a soft one
melon, saying Kiki do you love me for 13 minutes is not a proper review, other than that, satisfied
6:49
It certainly was a "big day" ... for garbage!
my wife’s really young my wife’s real small 
let’s go to the beach and play with a beach ball
praise Jesus, God, and my wife
let’s go to the beach and ride a bike
oooooh i love my wiiiiife 
i love my wife 
AhhhHGH
maybe chance's wife is a succubus
Same flannel he wore in the coloring  book review
cur-clap-rent field
Calling the Album "The Big Gay" for 13 minutes straight wasn't cool of you ANTHONY
Red flannel time!!
Chance bout to divorce his wife to make a comeback!
3.9k chance fans
L of the year
this album sounds it was made by someone who isn't really happy and is just trying to convince themselves that they made the right decisions in life.
😂
this will be know as The Bad Day.
It’s basically sesame street
How much for the Infinity Flannel?
OOH I LOVE MY WIFEEEE, I LOVEMYWIFE, AHGAE!!
IMA RIDA BIKEEEEE, RIDE A BIKE, AHGAE!!
GIVE HIM A CHANCE lolz
Lol you just don’t like chance because he was always like this.
You hatin on this, he had fun and its fun to listen too, boy advance gotta be bigger than diddy kong as in it needs to be big more like donkey kong. And skip the pros, im professor, like the famous basketball player from and1, you didnt get this album
Yo what if chance is trolling with this album and he drops the real album next month lol. Something about that album art makes me think this shit was a joke
Chance makes  an album about loving his wife 

Melonboi gives the album The “Speeding Bullet to Heaven” Treatment
Bone Thugs LOL
Why does this guy look like a discount Logic?
You forgot philanthropist in your intro, mane
1 year ago
Life is short like a midget, but mines a little MeLon
did he mean diddy comb?
The Big Disappointment
1 year
6:50 9:30
Great review Anthony, but calling this "The Big Gay" then making fun of his brother was very uncool.
who bedazzled this blank
The writing was on the wall with Coloring Book tbh
I think one of the problems with this album is that Chance just wants to have a bunch of famous people on his album and he didn't think through making songs that would fit the features.
Pitchfork gave it a 6.9.
Chance: Kanye’s best prodigy 

*Ok so that was a lie*
god damn...  chances are chance is done!
Tbh I think the pressure of putting out an album got to him and  had a lot to live up to since Coloring Book did sooo well. There are a few tracks like Slide around, Hot Shower, and We go high that bang out tho.
Can we get the infinity flannel as merch? I need it. Orrrrrr auction off the original one as seen in this video and donate to charity. 

I run a charity called "hey I need some money to like buy games and that" and we could use some funds
Chance the Husband
You need to drop that YBN cordae review asap, I'm already forming my own opinion.
Eternal was an actual good song
Near 3 mil views
This a...
This new infinity flannel...
It’s Not Good
Can you review Year 2 by Whoissas
I bet Chris Ray gun could take your lunch money melon
sounds like chance is over compensating for a seven year itch
i kinda enjoyed big day the song
siMILeS
Speeding bullet 2 heaven = 0.947/10
The Big Day = 0/10

Therefore : SB2H>TBD
문갤이 좋아요 박은 영상이다
I thought get a bag was pretty good
The Big Day? More like The Big *Gay* lol give me likes
What a rapper chance is! Never mentions his marriage life to us sad people that can't get a girl. I bet half of you mortals didn't even know he had a wife.
Not even good enough for a "NOT GOOD" segment. Ha, gotem.

I’m so dissapointed, his lyrics are so ugh, his voice is so sharp, its made my ears bleed. Production is flat at best. Hope he steps it up and bounce back, he has all the talent and is an amazing person that many of these new cats should look up to.
"It just makes me cringe so hard I feel like my teeth are going to grind down to nothing" 9:00 may take a while my dude you got some big ass teeth 😂😂😂
It's so weird that this album is so bad, because I see so many people acting like it's just fine. I see this album all the time in Tinder profiles, "best of" playlists, I straight up don't get it
MORE LIKE THE BIG GAY

AHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Chance has been horrible ever since after Acid Rap
I wonder what Chance thinks of his wife.
MA WAAAF
chance talks about being married more than logic saying he’s biracial
is there such a thing as a "strong" zero though?
If ski mask made hot shower rather chance i bet it’d actually be fire
man these rhymes sound like they're written by a bot using rhyme zone
good job
Jaden Smith: my ERYS album will be the worst album for melon
Chance the rapper: hold my Diddy Kong
Plz dont grind your teeth down to nothing they are the best in the game
Chance trolled everyone.
I can't get over the Dimmsdale Dimmadome line
I thought the album was pretty tight
Chance: Hot shower

Melon: Hot garbage

Me: yoooo
I'll take the infinity flannel.
Acid rap set the bar so high for us. Now everything is just booty
Hot shower is awful, but its hella catchy.
Never seen a 0 before damn
"Speedin Bullet 2 my Wife"
Rolls off the tounge surprisingly well
Chance the rapper pulling those hot diggity wife lovin bars
hey if you don't want that flannel i'll take it
i saw this coming. Chance was going to try to do what kanye  does. but he doesnt have the skills. If kanye supervisior produced this he could have quality controlled
Wheres the NF review?!!!!!!! He literally has the number 1 album
I think its funny that Chance actually thinks he should be considered a top 5 rapper of all time. Figure that one out.
You know damn well u tryna look like logic
i met Kanye West im never going to fail
I come back to this review just for when he reads the bars LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
11:30
That line just turned "Chance the Rapper" into "Give this rapper a chance"
00:09:00
Let's not forget NF has the worst number 1 album of all time 😆😂😂
Technically Chunky Kong is the biggest one.
bro it wasnt even that bad
imagine giving Peppa Pigs debut album a 8/10 then hitting Chance’s debut album with an absolute 0.
Chance went from a unique sounding, humble, young man to an emotional beta male
It's funny to me that Chance has a Death Cab for Cutie feature on this record, when the exact same criticisms people are throwing at Chanre were thrown at Ben Gibbard for how his writing changed following his marriage to Zoey Deschanel. We were all here hoping for Acid Rap meets Transatlanticism and we got The Big Day meets Codes & Keys.
wtf is that bottomless pitt remake behind cal
Are you just never gonna review nf. He legit got the number one album
The peppa pig album is genuinely better than this
I mean, I agree and stuff but it was kind of too far when you said Chance had to go back to Africa, sorry dude, I’m not there with you
Anthony got destroyed in this debate
"I'm 'bout to book a show at the dimmsdale dimmadome"

-Chance the Rapper

👏 👏 👏 🌟 🌟 🌟
He didn't say anything about Roo. I like that song
Me: thought album was 3/10
Melon: 0/10
Me: 0/10
slide around was pretty good because of pierre
We go high is my song!! You don't have to understand, but it has meaning to those who are seeing from his perspective on the track.
I think Hot Shower is fucking pathetic. He didn't even bother with a melody.
Listen to ghostface...that's baddddd
I deadass _gasped_ out loud when he gave the score

In the back of my mind I thought he would do it but I didn’t think he actually would
DAYUM BOI DAYUM BOIII
문스윙스갤러리랑 무슨 관련이냐
UMMM YEAH!! SO you are like DEAD ON! I feel like I don't know who the hell Chance is right now. He is not the Gospel rapper who was talking about his Grandma's candy, nor is he on an Ultralight Beam. I don't know if he fooled us all into believing he is something that he never was or has he lost that person who he was due to "too much success " and he is no longer hungry. Either way, I have got to say that I am no longer a fan. Chance was someone my parents liked because he seemed like a "good kid with a good head on his shoulders". He was a "good Christian boy", and in the Black community that goes along way. However, this album does everything it can to dispel Chance's image as a Christian rapper. There is no shortage of foul language or irrelevant messages. He needs to get back on "BRAND" if he wants to continue his success. This album is trash!
Breaking news : chance the rapper’s wife found dead in her home today and witnesses claimed that the saw a middle aged bald man breaking into the house
A 0/10 LOL 

He's already going to be on his death bed as I write this.
Chance the husband
omg fantany whyyyyy
He shouldn't have made all those kit kat commercials
The Large 24 Hours by Opportunity the Rhythmic Lyricist
I feel like albums with more than 20 tracks are more often than not pretty bad
boom boom baloom boom papeow papeow babaloom boom
you are bald
Wtf the title track wasn’t even that bad
At least the 0 wasn’t weak
"Acid Rap" legit made me go "Wow, this dude's different, he's gonna be something special"... Can't believe he went from that... To this! I straight up @ him on Twitter & said "This ain't it fam" resulting in a block... Shit's sad bruh.
Nothing will top Acid Rap
Huh didn't realised chance the rapper was inspired by kanye's post car accident joke saying that he was only in that car by chance. Haha thanks for the info melon!
Check Out Gloman Nino XXX freestyle
RIP Chance
Chances: *releases the big day*
Anthony fantano: Bro... Did you just post cringe?
Big fish was good
Chance should of made an album about having a Husband then everyone would of enjoyed it
Wait so what’s the difference between a 0 and a NOT GOOD ?
The "BIG" gae...



🍵👨‍🏫
didn't enjoy the indie gospel rap hentai fusion chance tries in this album
Hot damn hot water hot shower
69k likes




*Nice*
Fun fact: Chance is married, Logic is biracial, Kenny Beats is white and an officer.
I’d give it a 3
“I’m about to book a show at the dimsdale dimmadome??” LMFAOOO
Why is this not good but it's 0/10, shouldn't it be not good? I'm confused
Offensive vocal performances lol
idk i kinda like 'get a bag' 


It's like pop and rap raped a sequencer and made a song.
I like big fish. I don't love it but I put it on my playlist. It's the only song on this album that I like at all. Hot shower is so bad I couldn't listen to it all.
This is the most wrong review I've ever seen you give it's amazing
wait i'm sorry i'm new. is zero not "not good"?
I knew it was bad, because Cal didn't come out..... Not even once, I even see on your face, this was a legitimate failure. I listened to the album before, listening to your review, and I can agree with your score.
Lemon can you review Japanese band Sakanaction's latest album 834.194? They are a popular experimental rock band with dance and synthrock influences, please Anthony Opentano.
Anthony you took too long to drop this video people kept asking me what i thought of the album and i kept having to run away.
The big gay lol
a 0 is definitely worse than a NOT GOOD goddamn
Was NOT expecting a Lupe Fiasco reference.
Wow i thought i was the only this album was HORRIBLE thanks 😂
how did this dude go from acid rap and coloring book to THIS
The big day more like the big gay
5:42 all those similes are references to tv shows, movies and video games lmao
Good Ass Job gon be 10 fs
Is this the big gay Muchdank talkin about?
If chance had played this album on his honey moon he'd probably be divorced right now
The amount of likes is how many times he pushed his glasses up his face
Yeah I agree quite a bit, wasn’t what Chance really could have done. Only song I really like is Big Fish
idc Handsome is a bop
Hot shower was the best song on the album wdym?
Speeding bullet to heaven 2: electric bugaloo
Cringe the Rapper.
binaural beats
Just listened to this. It was Ok at first. Corny bars but it was fine... Then I got to Hot Shower. It was only downhill from there (save a few tracks I actually quite like).
Please wear the flannel
I’ve been on Chance since day 1 and I was in shock by how let down I was. Sounded like Seasme Street garbage...No Oscar 

: (
whats the difference between a 0 and a  not good score?
I hope Kanye produces Eminem’s next album🖤
I just tried to listen to it and the only song I like is the one with Gucci Mane
He said OFFENSIVE vocal performances 😭😭
LOOOOOOOOOL CHANCE JUST GOT A SPEEDIN BULLET 2 HEAVEN
so sad
😴😴😴
9:06 how i feel about literally every eminem song past 2007
REVIEW GAMER
The rumoured Kanye & Chance collab project a 10 confirmed
Pippi Long?

Pippi Long as in Pippi Longstocking??

Pippi Long as in Pippi Longstocking the European children's character from the 50s???

:O

Future scientists probing the ruins of civilisation will identify that line as Patient Zero in a kind of musical pandemic  :O
He’ll still get the bag. And the positive press. And the nominations. 😕 And the guest spot on SNL. And more innovative producers/rappers will go unnoticed. And the guest spot on SNL.
"generally favorable reviews' So you're the odd one.
For the first time I actually agree with this sorry excuse of a man 😳
Nobody:
Chance The Rapper: MY WIFE IS AMAZING I LOVE MY KIDS
Gooose egg
chance is happy so the rate
The album is so bad that Chance the rapper should just be called Chance
No it's not just an opinion this time. 🚮 Lmao it's a fact at this point.
"my next tour got 8 legs like daddy long"

😂
The worst part is you all thought Chance The Rapper was good in the first place ....
U go lowest
IGH
Peppa what are you doing in this review? 😏😏😏
Chance went from lyrics like: "They be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot"
To: "I'M MARRIED I LOVE MY WIFE AHH"
I only looked this video up because I see Chance has apparently fallen off and I remember 'listening' to this album. I skipped pretty much the whole thing.
I have to be honest I enjoyed this album to the point of not understanding why people thought this was bad. But I’m really glad to have to this clarification, I agree and understand it now. I still like this album but I don’t take it as seriously as I did now
Chance wife look like a man 🚫🧢
Hey
I've never laughed as hard as I did while watching this video, jesus christ
Anyone else notice Peppa Pig in the outro tho?
Surprisingly good like/dislike ratio
WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND REVIEW PLZ
Love how you just ignored the #1 rap album in the usa
“Hot shower... more like hot garbage” yoooo melon is wildin😂😂😂😂
What’s the difference between a 0 and a Not Good?
hmmm
his new style of rapping where he just talks sucks
The Big Funny
Honestly sometimes I don't even come for the review I just come for the comments
I totally agree ..!!!!..I felt every piece of this review..!!)
Lil pump is better confirmed
how is the dorito commercial song he did better then this
So funny!
Jesus Christ he VIOLATED lmao and committed straight fatality. I knew he wasn't gonna give it a good grade by far. I didn't even think the album was that good. but to give it a grade...THAT low is insane xD appreciate your honesty though bro!
Hot shower is terrible, I was shocked Chance made it
I feel as though artists only make good shit when they’re on drugs. Eminem, Kanye, Wayne, and now chance. Not saying it’s a bad thing they’re off shit but still where’s the creativity
Kcuf!!!! Kodewa bakabakbakbakabakabakabakabakabaka nani?!?!?!?!?!?
I feel like Chance The Rapper is one of those hip hop artists that will be more of a TV/Hollywood personality and will never release another great project. And not because he isn’t capable of it, but i think Chance has more of a Will Smith/Snoop Dogg/LL Cool J/ type of appeal
I feel like chance is over the hill unfortunately. I don't think we're ever gonna hear another Acid Rap caliber album.
Chance got married?! Yeah right, next you'll tell me that Logic is biracial.
If you haven't listened to the album yet you should and make your own opinion on it because it's not that terrible.... It's still pretty trash and he actually does talk about his wife waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy to much but there are some songs the fan's will like

Edit 2/10
The Big Gay
” I now know why it's clear. It's clear because I can see right through this B.S.”😂😂😂
hot damn hot water hot trash
Yo guys is chance married?
_Metaphors > Similes._
Isn't this basically a NOT GOOD review?
*Chance the rapper drops new album*



Me: 12:49
Logic - I'm biracial 
Kendrick (2011-2013) - I got some Nappy Hair
Chance the Rapper - I love my wife.
I feel that Chance is about to bounce back in big fashion but for now yea this shit is fucking trash. It's sad because you enter the track and alright the first song is bad but then Death Cab is on there with chance just getting by with some semi-conscious bars and got me exicted for a second..... Then there is Hot Shower. Yeesh what am I suppose to say. Like Da Baby is fire but everything after this just stays in an area bouncing from 8 year old tik tok video and then topics of songs are awful as well..... Like Eternal or Big Fish or Ballin Flossin or every track on here. Like I hear Francis and I get slightly exicted again and then fucking somone I guess forgot to turn off the mic cause someone starts yelling. My overall review is summed up by the 9:10
Lol I think Melon really missed the point of the “professor” line. I don’t think he knows the professor is one of the most well known “street ball” players. Album is trash tho.
why isn't anyone talking about that "avoiding meetings like vegans" line??
why a zero and not just a not good?
That "I need you this season like a flu shot" bar sounds like something off of Revival.
Damn great value Logic over here doing song reviews.
Honestly I can see him having a Kid Cudi experience with Anthony’s reviews. Maybe his relationship will start going south, eventually get a divorce, and he’ll make an album on that topic which ends up being actually meaningful and interesting with a shorter, more digestible runtime
holy shit, this was a lot harsher than i expected lol
ugly god album is the next zero
Chance only had 1 good album Coloring Book.... The rest are straight trash...  He been trash
F
The big gay
Chance: *talks about his wife*

[Everybody disliked that]
I like hot shower, but not much else
Pippy long bottom referance hahahahhahahaha
Why was this not a Not Good?
The Jew card always trumps the black one.
Wow fantano, you really pulled a sneaky on us with that red flannel. Can’t believe you gave it a 10/10. Not sure if I agree with you that hot shower is a top 10 song of the decade but everyone’s entitled to an opinion.
agree
Why don’t you review NF?
There’s a typo in the title
It’s called The Big Gay.
Is this Fantano only 0/10 I'm curious tbh
dont let this album getting a zero distract you from the fact that cal has the infinity flannel
ANTHONY FANDANGO SECRETLY LOVES THIS ALBUM AND HE IS USING THIS REVIEW TO TEST HIS INFLUENCE ON THE MUSICAL SPHERE
a strong zero 🙏
Did this album make Chance lose all his credibility
Should be called The Big Crap
You’re just mad because Chance bit Cal’s style on “Hot Shower”.
Is a zero worse than not good?
Most hilarious points in review because of how annoyed fantano is

1:35-1:46
2:00-2:06
2:38-2:53
5:00-5:41
6:49-6:53
9:06-9:22
11:16-11:30
12:04-12:33
Chance: “I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell 
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail”


He failed.
OMG Chance went from Grammy-winning best rap album of the year 2017 to a "strong 0"
Then we have hot shower... more like hot garbage 😂😂😂😂
Wow, someone must not love their wife
Logic and Chance had potential to do great things. FAIL
watch in x1.25 speed and melon sounds 25% angrier. not for the faint of heart.
Theory: Anthony here is only mad because Chance has hair and he doesn’t
Every artist has at least 1 album that doesn’t do good and flops. This is that one for Chance.
They just open a roasting session for Chance in these comments 😂😂😂😂😂
lmao @12:26 to 12:34 made me choke on my water. never seen him give a zero lmao
I genuinely forget that cal is just a character sometimes.
13:24
Uh oh... I know that look.
Melon is thinking about killing Cal again.
You had better bars at the end of this video than chance the rapper 😂😂
"I need Stock and it gotta be Pippi Long" I nearly died of cringe.
I’m about to book a show at the dimmsdale dimmadome 😐😂 his face sold that one for me
"... If she ever find a melon, he better love her ... ah ah ah" - Chance the Rapper
i just want 10day and acidrap chance again :(
Oooh I love my wife, I love my wife (AAHH)

Let’s go ride a bike, ride a bike (AHHH)
gotta admit i was expecting alot more of this album. But quiet a few tracks are fire
Nobody: 
Chance: I LOVE MY HUSB... WIFE
Big Fish, Roo, Slide Around, Ballin Flossin & Hot Shower were the Best Tracks on the Album.. Out of like 22.
Lmao bruh I’m cryin. Chance album so damn trash 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Chance became logic and logic became a thing of the past
12:35 he really can't see without his glasses 😂😂
change the rapper (exists)
melon: I give it a strong 0
change the rapper fans: 13:15
*ooooouu I love my wiiiiife, I love my wife!*
been a chance fan for well over 3 years and waited soooo long for this album with high expectations after coloring book but as soon as i heard that trash as song groceries, i knew it was gonna flop and i was even more disappointed and let down hearing the album. hot shower is literally the worst and most annoying songs i’ve ever heard. i really hope he bounces back but damn dude this was terrible. onto gambino 😣
Acid rap was amazing, his short film Mr.Happy was stunning, profound, and shaking...

Then he became extremely religious and raps disingenuously.
Can someone make a compilation of Anthony’s character please! I love him soo much!
“I’M gonna wear it” “I’M gonna wear it now” 
🤣🤣
Smino was good on the track tho
Zero? Damn 😂
I typed Chance the Rapper on YouTube, and this is the first video that comes up.
Their gunna pass this album around in church . But the album is great for breaking my weed on.
Am I the only one that really liked Zanies and fools?
Ooh I love my wiiiife
oo oo i love my WIIIIFE AHH
Some on-point foreshadowing with "Muder Ballads" hanging in the background
The first lyrics referenced reminded me of t dubs flow on mario be playin
The beginning of the 2nd verse in We Go High is fire.. you don’t really understand rap if you don’t get it.. but other than that... this album was bad.
You know the albums shit when boonk gang drops better bars then chance
React to anonymuz no threat album not many reviews on this guy yet I'd like to see your take
5 year plan made me start laugh so hard that I couldn't listen to the rest of it.
H&M music was a comment I saw on one of his videos and that was the best explanation to date hahaha
Hearing Chance this god damn happy on such a garbage record makes me want to have a wife and two kids some day.
Damn Fantano you went too hard on him chill out!!
Tell me how you really feel 💯
the small day
Town on the hill sounds like an idea you had for a book when you were 5 years old
11:30 idk why but I lol'd so hard
He need to get paid more then Diddy & more then Kong , y’all just ain’t on chance time
Wait a minute.....The Red Flannel. Watch Out for Chance
Actin like y’all care about lyrics now lmao
You're really good at this reviewing lark.
Where is the best place to listen to this album? Ready go!
I feel like the title song is just a worse version of prom night 💀
Keep in mind this album rated lower than ERYS
Thank god he has to wait to review my album until next year it’s 50 plus tracks lol
I agree with this video but you went too far when you said chance should just beat his wife if this is the result of him loving her that much. Too far Anthony
Melon aint letting up😂
He sounds like these recent rappers, that's what's going on, these soundcloud lyrics are just fucking weird
you need more competition in your field of youtube music reviewing.. or at least more competition with a backbone
Can you review the new Mini Mansions album? ❤️
Bro imagine chance gets divorced and his wife takes half, he’s gonna look like a clown and a simp for this album. I love my wife eh
Ohhhhh I love my wifeee I love my wife
OOO I LOVE MY WIFE, IGH
I'm feeling a light to decent BIG GAY on this one
Can’t wait for the new Don Iver album Melon! Bon is the Donny Wahlberg of the two.
Hilarious review, one of your best!
Ooooo I love my wife AAGH
"Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I'm professor" is such an underrated line jeeez...guess Melon never had the And1 Mixtape
Slide around was 🔥
I would have to agree I’m a huge chance fan and listening to this whole album was honestly so hard to get through for sure his worst album ever
Please do a review for Northlane new album alien please 🙏🙏
Would you have bumped it up to a one if he had included the track first world problems?
I’ve never agreed with you more Melon boi
Please review Dum & Dummer by Young Dolph and Key Glock
Can we get a no words review for this
review divino nino - foam
React to Lil Durk Ls4ts2 plz
Can you review the bonus track?
he’s been going downhill
You know whose album released at the same time that wasn't garbage? NF's The Search. Good lord, what an amazing album.
So are we going to introduce this album to prisons to stop reoffending .....
Imagine waiting 3 years for this project only to come out garbage
I usually try and avoid Fantano's vids as I feel like I dont need someone to tell me what music to like and dislike, though I do respect his understanding of music. This time however I could not agree more, this album was such a let down, especially since its been so long since we had a solid Chance drop. Hard 0 hands down lmao
Durks part was good on Slide around 🤷‍♀️
Ive written bars for 2 years and can spit better than most of this album lmao, WTF has chance done to his legacy man
AGH ‼️
the way you read the lyrics cracks me up
GO AHEAD MELON HEAD
disappointed  this is andys first take on smino :(
This album has modern eminem type bars
But Melon I like the album, its catchy.
so disappointed... my hero is dying and he’s killing himself... 😔
Damn I didn't hear anything positive
I never understood why people liked this guy at all lmao when acid rap came out I was mind boggled that people enjoyed those awful ab Libs
This man is really coming after Chance
I don’t get why so many people were hating on the “I made the 3 more famous then Steph” line like it wasn’t a bad bar at all 😂
Turn that 0 upside down it's a 0 now
I liked it. 🤷‍♂️most of it
Chance has officially fell off
i miss the old chance...
wait that's a kanye song
5:13 cmon, that’s a fire bar
12:25 Daaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmnnnn
6:50
10:05 😂
Is this some sort of trick?  Will he release a fire mixtape next week?
This album doesn't express his love for his wife.
I thought you were exaggerating about hot shower but then I listened to it and I lowkey mistook it for my local shitty soundcloud rappers mixtape
melon was just mad cuz lil mosey wasnt featured in the album
NF's album is insane
Obviously Anthony is just jealous about how much chance loves his wife
wasn't cal on anthony's right-hand side before?
"More like hot garbage" like earned
Bro please violate his album please.
Good Ass Job bout to be a 10/10
After this review Chance the rapper becomes Chances the Hitman.
House music and gospel
actually i have to say this isn't a fair review.. big fish, five year plan and we go high are good songs
Hot shower is my fav song lol
STRONG 0 LMFAO
W I F E
Dam people still talking about logic that album still blew up and had at least 4bangers....unlike this
Quadeca sent me here
melon tooted 4:10
I've always said Trash the Rapper 💯💯💯
Why u so mean to cal?
0/10? Ok it wasn’t good i understand...but a zero my guy?? Trippin. The lowest I go would be a 3.5 but i personally give it a 5.6
The professor is a real good street basketball player who doesn’t play pro ball.
Chill bro... chiiiiill
Give chance a break he worked hard
Chance really had us waiting this long for a shit album 🤦🏿‍♂️
The good burger bar was some heat though lol 90’s baby shit
They need to just take the diamonds off that CD, cause this album ain’t even gonna go plastic. 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Eternal was alright
The album was pretty shit. I only like 4 of the 22. The song called big day. Really pissed me off like wtf was that screaming bullshit. But regardless only like 4 out of 22. That's terrible. I think he'll make a great comback though.
"Don iver" had me on the floor
I AGREE, im a huge fan of his but this album doesnt feel like him. ITs like he made this album cuz he had to not cuz he wanted to. Idk he maybe busy.
Kanye saved Kid Cudi, he shall now save Chance with a collab
alright guys, this may be a stretch but Chance may be extremely satisfied with his marriage
The WORST part about this.......... is that Chance is most definitely going to watch this if he hasn’t already 😂🤣🙏⚰️🤦🏽‍♂️

EDIT: I post great rappers’ music from my hometown they may surprise you!
On a brighter side....Slipknot just dropped a new track
Do NF, you won’t regret it
Yo Anthony, i Know the álbum was bad, but stating that Chance can be better if he gets “whipped enough by his master” is just outrageous...
“Oooo I love my wiiiife I love my wife..ACK!”
Melon hates this album cause he doesn't love his wife simple as that.
Ooo I love my wIIiiIife, I life my wife AGHHH
I blame love, marriage and family
i'm bout to book a show at the dimmsdale dimmadone 😩👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Check out Murder Ballads in the back
Speedin' Bullet To Matrimony...
How’d u not shout out smino... smh
Ybn Cordae’s new album sounded more like a Chance album than Chance’s new album
lil pump: I have the most worst verse ever

change: I NEED STOCK AND IT GOTTA BE PIPI LONG
Your shirts a 0 out 10
He has on the red flannel and Chance is talking about suicide on Twitter now. 🤔🤔🤔
You just hated it because you think chance the rapper sounds too much like Led Zepplin, admit it Melon.
You didn't have to call his debut album "The Big Gay" bro, not cool.
They did SWV dirty
Kiki do you love me isn't a rap flow is a chorus melody
What if the point of the album was to make a really bad album?
Melon: I'm feeling a strong 0 on this album

Chance: Say sike right now
It was inconsistent, but I liked it overall...



Too bad I have to change my opinion now
So Good Ass Job gonna be a 10
I liked the second track so that's 1/22.
I'd give it a .4/10
Where is the SAILOR REVIEW
I pray for the kid cudi effect on the next album
Chance the Rapper's rap in the Doritos SuperBowl commercial was more fire than this entire album
hot shower
We go high
Chance has god on his side and still can’t make a good album
Another man's blood stains the melon's shirt.




*Wonderful*
chance or melon
“Kanye’s best prodigy”

Bro Travis would never do me like this
Chance is trying hard to do something new. Not working out though
i kinda like the fran drescher nanny line
I get the album cover now... This album is as hard to listen to as those diamonds. Genius 10/10.
Hot Shower literally sounds like a Cal Chuchesta song
I thought not good was 0?
Let's hope Chance won't drop Kamikaze 2 as a response to all this backlash.
Game boy advance fam
Anthony is mad because chance Love his wife and not him
Angwy melon
You make valid points, however I do feel like you really dislike his style personally so there's some subjective bias. For me I like several songs off of all of Chance's projects, including this one, but all of his projects I pretty much skip through to the songs I like whenever I'm in a chance mood. I am still holding out for him to bring a project that you want to listen to start to finish, like Machine Gun Kelly just achieved with Hotel Diablo.
My boy Melon was ripping Chance so hard his upper lip started sweating
And to believe people actually want chance to produce for kanye lol the nerve of these people
*Only way for Chance to bounce back from this is if he gets divorced.*
Ohhhh, so the see through disc on the cover is a foreshadow of the nothingness that is to come
Bruh
"Then we have the track Hot Shower. More like Hot Garbage!" 
Damn, Anthony. 😂
This album is the personification of that one creepy nerdy guy in prom trying to sing a cheesy love song to that popular cheerleader girl he’s been crushing on. And failing.
So uh you’re wrong
hot shower is the worst for sure. Is it a lil pump parody or something ?
I feel like this review is way too harsh. I guess this is your honest opinion. But, I thought there were a lot of dope parts to the album. A lot of the production is really beautiful. I dug Chance's flow in I Got You, etc. But hey, I guess that's just my honest opinion :^)
Yikes
chance the rapper is so overrated and cringy
His wife is going to be a widow now. Thanks Melon.
Tyler childers
agree.
Chance should pivot to Christian rap

He already has the quality
Anthony: Red Flannel with “ugh face” in thumbnail
Me: ooooh that’s not good...
The worst part is hes literally been married for less than five months and he's already written a whole album about it  🤦🏽‍♂️😂
You better wear the infinity flannel melon
“I’m professor”

Like the extremely famous streetballer. But yes the rest of the lyrics are nonsensical
I love chance but this review is just right...
I never thought I would hear a pipi long stocking bar
Now I finally know the meaning of hat on coloring book "3" is number of good mixtape he is going to make.
Bro, please, PLEASEEEEE make a video of you just reading the lyrics from this album. Only Chance's parts. Thank you
🔥 22 TRACK TORTURE CHAMBER 🔥
You know that Flamin’ Hot Doritos commercial with the Backstreet Boys? How is it that that collab is better than this?
Yeah I stopped listening to this guy when he said Bubsy 3d was only a 7
If ya’ll want great Chicago rappers, try Saba and Noname and Smino.
crazy how most publications are praising the album. It's hot garbage.
All Day Long, Do You Remember, Eternal, Hot Shower, We Go High, The Big Day, Lets go on a run, Get A Bag, Sun Comes Down, Town On The Hill. Solid 10 songs on this album not as bad as people are saying it is. I especially love the sampling and sound on Get a Bag im a sucker for Chance beats
I really thought the album cover was going to be the wackest part about this album when he released the cover art. BOY WAS I WRONG.
"they can't take out splinterrs"

😂
do you love your wife melon? Because if not ima have to report you to authorities
We just not gonna talk about the dopeness of the infinity flannel?
*slams phone* WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SIMILES?!

- Anthony Fantano, 2019
The music matches the bland ass cover art
That's a chunky ass cd tho.
Review Wonderwall (by Oasis)
I like what you’re doing with the hands
at least he put acid rap on spotify before...
"We cant be out here pleasing everybody"‐chance
11:29 "I see right through this BS"
That album was the first album I completely deleted off of my phone. Shit was hot garbage
6:49 "then we have the track called hot shower... more like hot garbage."
5:02 I can’t stop laughing 🤣his writing is so bad 🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been a chance fan and saw him live when Acid Rap was new. I’m so disappointed with this album.
Inb4 "inifnity flanel shirt now available on representdotcom"
I LOVETHONY 
MY WIFETANO
I miss when Chance used to do drugs
Sometimes when I hear that an album is absolute trash, I get the overwhelming desire to hear it.  Lord, help me.
chance “i love my wife” the rapper
Some of the songs could've slapped if he used more original flow, and if he toned down the cringy background noises😂
Acid rap is all I liked from chance
Your face in the thumbnail pretty much sums up the album. I'm not even mad, just disappointed.
Chance been wack imo
im confused how you can give something a 0 and not have this under the "not good" series?
thank u 4 this 💚🖤
The Search album review?
I liked the good burger thing it made me laugh 😂
13:24 But why Anthony Fantano's "Transition" Rap at the end better than chances entire album?? 😂👀
OOH I LOVE MY WIFE, I LOVE MY WIFE AHH
I honestly thought the 0/10 was a meme
Good review Anthony this album was boring as hell and I was struggling to finish it, that's how you know it's bad
I LOVE MY WIFFEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
REVIEW “THE SAILOR” FROM RICH BRIAN
You forgot in the bad lyrics section, in the song 5 year plan, the lyrics at the end are so lazily delivered and bad:

“I don't know, why do birds Burt Bacharach?
Why do worms prefer habitats?
Why did it occur where it happened at?
Why ain't no apples in Apple Jacks?”
10:05 YOU FORGOT A HUG!
I hope my boy can bounce back from this. PULL THROUGH CHANCE.
DYN-O-MITE IS ALBUM OF THE YEAR ! ITS A MUST REVIEW!!!!
Need u in the season like a flu shot lowkey hard tho
I want a Smino review from you
Hey Anthony could you please review case study 01 by Daniel Caesar? I’ve been waiting over a month to have an opinion
Now this does put a smile on my face
thumbnail says it all LMAOO
Mike C-Town is gon love this.
Chance the daddy
Do the sailor by rich Brian
Why isn't this one of the "Not Good" reviews? I mean he gave it a  zero...
6:14
Side chicks and side .... dudes
hesitated for a second there melon
How did this happen?! I have no idea what exactly went wrong with this album. Major dissapointment, the first time I heard it.
i love my wife AH
should have just called this a not good
Umm,  is that a Stain on his shirt ?





*Instantly Discredited*
Mack le more 😂 dead
What really upsets me is that he released this sorry-ass album on my birthday
PEPPA THE RAPPA: "The PIG Day"
Album review or a straight grilling
Well, the cover art is neat
It’s trash... I really did try to force myself to like it.... but the shit trash🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😩😩
Why ain’t you reviewing Indigo álbum?
Very good production, very forgettable
I hate chance the rapper as an artist.he has 1000 features and never stands out on any of his tracks.hes the most overrated artist in modern rap.and this is someone from Chicago!
nobody:
melon: dethgrips
I dunno dude, I liked the album.
Hot shower also sounds like womp womp by valee the flow is very similar
If the movie "The Room" was in music form...this would be it.
mmm dat lip sweat
That’s a lower score than Kid Cudi’s Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven
Chris Browns indigo Album has some of the best music out right now.
Damn... tell them why your angry!
Anthony Fantano doesn’t love his wife
Hot damn hot water hot shower
This is so bad it has to be a joke. I’ll be waiting for the release of the real album lol
Bro do artists make their best music when they're in a bad place or state because I swear they do
💀
Can we all go and listen to the real rapper and the album which fuses hip hop, indie, dream pop, rock into one aka MONO by RM.
The sailor?
Tony, listen, it's about time to go completely-smooth bald
Why'd you have to do Chance like that, at least give him a NOT GOOD
When he dropped the phone I was dead lol
Album was straight A S S
Another instant classic review from our bald machine-gAnthony
>0/10
>not a NOT GOOD
> *boi*
Anyone else coming from a meme page
Ouch. When did we cross the threshold of needing such high stimulation to get a kick outta some rap? Asking everyone. I somewhat enjoyed the album, but I feel that hitting up some maxed out wubs in a club are more on point these days. Coming from an acidrap Stan
Ive never been a chance fan, this review didn't wanna make me try to reprogram that 😂
His mixtapes are like albums, his albums are like mixtapes
Chance fans at 1:36: *OH GOD MELON PLEASE DON'T*
I thought the album was pretty good.
Wait...so is this below a Not Good album or above it?
You almost made chance kill himself lol
finally you fucking rate something right thanks i guess
You forgot lil Durk
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I liked the album but he most def cud of done better. I didn’t really feel his vibe much.. it’s like he was forcing himself into stuff
Acid rap #1, 10 day and colouring book tied 2nd/3rd followed by all his singles then this album... idk it just feels lazy
I rather listen to needle drops tran... sition outro on a Kanye beat that to that bs.
I thought if it's a 0 it's a not good he says
I came to this album after the lost boy sooo the album sucked in my opinion and this kinda confirmed my opinion
Wear the Infinity Flannel
At least the albums fucking different. 9/10
I miss the old kanye
Chance got 8 debut albums
Guys I don’t think Melon enjoyed this record.
This album sounded like a Sesame Street soundtrack
But what about Get a Bag. That jaunt kinda bumps
chance has been sent to the shadow realm
Hahahah came here just to hear you slam this
Anthony your criticism cannot be based just on his race.
aka the big dump.
I like to imagine Anthony punching the shit out of a physical copy of this record while Cal attempts to hold him back.
HATEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"I hate my kids"


-Chance the rapper
The funniest part was him reading the lyrics. Lmao I'm out in public crying rn trying to hold in this laughter
His poor wife, she didn't ask for this.
Big gooooooose egg
So basically he’ll bounce back in a collab with Kanye called “Good guys meet robot teddy bears” and it’ll get 10/10
how can be the self-titled song so incredibly bad
Do you have any love in your life?
Thought the album was pretty good actually. Glad I listened to your opinion so I could change my opinion of the album. Thanks melon.
Finally people see how overrated Chance is
You did cry in the corner for all the afternoon after the review, the outro tells it.
cant watch this vid because of the terrible album cover
I loved chance but something happened to him man...
Fantano you have a stain on your shirt (one square stage left and up from the second button). You should use a strong biodetergent.
Goodbye. Love you
i wonder what his wife thinks
Damn Melon God you didnt have to put a 0 to Chance just because he doesnt like vegetables
Melon we all know you hate this album because you don’t love your wife anymore
Tell me more about this “Don Iver” guy he sounds interesting
9:30 cringe as hell LMAO
Dammnn, I've never witnessed an Anthony Fantano 0/10. And I sure as hell wouldn't have expected it to come from Chance the Rapper 😱
Can someone tell me what black and white album that is in the background? I would really appreciate that!
“I met Kanye West I’m never going to fail”





That didn’t age well
I can’t believe this mess was released by the same person who made Acid Rap. 😔
Why not a NOT GOOD?
I wonder if chance the rapper got married?
Nobody:

Chance: Ooo I love my wife, I love my wife IGH!
"FAV TRACKS: n/a"

Jesus, Anthony.
Melon: Not good
Cordae: You are cowect, my bwotha
I can finally form an opinion...even though I haven't heard a song from this album. Thanks Melon.
My exact words this morning.
“Oh nooo, the red flannel? Man”


“OHHHH, *zero out of ten!?* Jesus melon”
This whole album is just “yeah I have a wife, I love her, I love Jesus too, I bring my wife to church and we pray to Jesus, it’s awesome”
You know Anthony hates an album when he gives it a 0/10 instead of a NOT GOOD
I'm just gonna go listen to some acid rap. Cause this is depressing 😔😢
The hardest part about listening to this atrocity is knowing people will think this is a 10/10 AOTY.
i can't see chance the rappers name without thinking of the "i love my wife AHH" meme
Is this the first zero? Kid Cudi at least got 0,6 or something
I love how there are more dislikes for Acid Rap’s 6/10 instead of this 0/10 lmao
More like Chance the crapper...
NF The Search review?
Chance said "like" like a hundred times on every song. I got bored
“Bon Iver’s less talented cousin, Don Iver”
I love the album
Awesome music 💜💜💜
I love Ari Lennox vocals on I got you but gawd chance just kills it
The A.V. Club A
Chicago Tribune 3/4 stars
Entertainment Weekly A−
The Guardian 4/5 stars
NME 3/5 stars
Pitchfork 6.9/10
TheNeedleDrop 0/10
My problem with "music review" is it is subjective. I agree this album is not good. But music is a feeling. It is how you relate to it. Some grows into you. Kudos to artists who create rather than who destroys.
Chance is really all over this album talking about how awesome marriage is like he's been at it for 10+ years when he's only been married for a few months. Like Is your wedding planner in the credits too, guy? Damn
Don’t forget how bad the album cover is too
*It feels like Chance ad-libbed the whole album*

Like he walked into the studio and just let it happen to himself
I didn't even listen to the album and I totally agree. Great job Melon.
His face when he was reading the lyrics got me dead 💀💀💀
Over reaction... album was great IMO.
I’m not gonna lie, I kinda like hot shower
it's official, the more money Chance has, the worse his mixtapes/albums get.
Logic now has some competition for Worst Album of 2019
By the laws of physics Chance's next album will legally receive a 10/10
I thought it was good burger shoulda taught you we all through, not dudes. Anyways. I didnt like the album either but hot shower was the only one i could possibly listen to. I thought it was actually comical.
It sucked...the beats were wack and none were catchy.
Honestly my opinion is that he started out strong and with each mixtape got weaker and this album is just absolute utter garbage, 10 Day was his best by far then Acid Rap with Coloring Book not far behind. Then this.. this absolute mess.. The Big Day.. it was probably the worst album from one of the few artists I expected infinitely times better from.. more like The Big Sad.
I give it a 1 outta 10 cause one song that I honestly didn't even care to remember the name of I thought had a good beat.
HOLY SHIT ANOTHER 10!??!!?? I think 2019 is the best year for music...
Check out NF......like you haven't heard that already. What's the worry?
Pretty bum album but hot shower ain’t hot garbage
I liked Big Fish at least. The rest is anywhere between forgettable and intolerable.

Its crazy how YBN Cordae really dropped a better Chance album than Chance did
So he emulated Lupe's worst album
Videos too long for this topic. Just say it's trash and give it zero and move on. The album is so bad , I can't even listen too his old songs anymore. I'm just too scarred and traumatized by the fact that when he needed to bring out his best he gave us his worst , as if he never took his craft seriously in the first place and was just letting the drugs he was taking write his past songs and now with his debut album , it sounds like it was written by his newly found monogamy and sobriety , and the lyrics sound like he hired a 10 year old child ghost writer that gave him the lyrics written in crayons on the back of a cereal box.
so what you’re saying is I shouldn’t give this album a CHANCE
"it just makes me cringe so hard I feel like my teeth are going to grind down to nothing"

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CHANCE?! HE'S GOT THE BEST TEETH IN THE GAME!?
haha i love when bald internet man get mad
When industry plants go wrong..
Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven (0.9) > The Big Day (0)
In 3 years Good ass Job will drop and give chance a 10/10 right after yandhi comes out a month before it to get a 9/10 and another pusha album that'll get an 8/10
I came to hear what I heard and I hated it
People saying this album trash
Lmao the best part about this is that he can't get you fired because you're your own employer.
"I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail"

....mhmm
Jeez melon I know you didn’t like album but did you have to wish death onto his unborn seed?
That boy need drugs. Trying to hard.
Yooo that clear album BS Joke was hella Clutch!! That’s some real shit tho, couldn’t take this album seriously when you can see right thru it 🙄
Reader, go listen to Dorian Electra's album. That review has 10% of the views and is actually good.
I don't get how Groceries was so Chance and this album is so NOT
I respect chance as a person. But this is setting the bar like Drake low
I come from the future, Chance will make a collab album with Ye and call it Teens see Angels and pulls a Kid Cudi 2.0 and goes from 0 to hero
Logic: Lol I’m gonna have the worst album of the year
Chance: *I wouldn’t count on that one chief*
“I met Kanye West, I’m never going to fail” 😗
Chance was like: let's record this shit in 77 mins i have to go back to my wife
"it's like a bad death grips impression"
guys this is so cringe
I liked parts of hot shower probably my favorite song on the album at this point, but completely as a Chance song, not that great
You don't like this album?  You don't love your wife...
Finally a review I actually agree with from this strange man
I actually feel sick to my stomach admitting just how bad this album is considering I absolutely love everything Chance has ever put out.

Yet I think Do You Remember, Eternal, I Got You, and Big Fish are actually really enjoyable tracks.
This one of the funniest shits I done watched
Killer review mate . I made it to track 5 , then kinda skipped through the rest . I just couldn’t get into it . I did give it another try but you’re right . This is pretty bad .. just about to bump Cordae again thou . It’s more promising already .. ✌🏼
Hot Shower sounds like a satire like some sort of Tiny Meat Gang song to make fun of trap.
Listen to Live on Ice by Tobi Lou. Best summer album 2019
I love my wiiiiifeeee
9:06 this is absolutely what i felt throughout most of the album just a big "ah? oooh..."
Ooooh I love my wifeeee ooooh I love my wife AAH
This album takes forever to end my God I swear this album was so dissapointing.
Check out the sweat building up on Anthony's uppen lip through-out the review.
I love this channel because it’s the embodiment of just calling it like you see it, Fantano gives us his unfiltered opinion straight from his head
It was dead, and it's triple J's feature album this week... So I haven't listened to triple J this week.
The Big Day: Disney XD Edition
5:04 best part of the review
Dang this review made me sad :( I like the album :(
Oh man, digging the Nick Cave album back there. Sweet!
Holy shit dude that Infinity Flannel legitimately made me laugh.
My friend told me he really liked the skits in defense of the album.
Francis is Bon Iver's less talented cousin, finally some said it
I enjoyed Melon’s review more than the album.
This review will be remembered for a lot of things but perhaps the most important thing is that it brought back the wifebeater transition
alright so what does this sound effect mean? 0:13 it pops up everywhere for seemingly no reason, someone clue me in pls?
How does this guy never review an NF album. His new album should be rap album of the year! 🔥
wax's new song "station break" has some pretty dope fran drescher rhymes in it
*AHHH*
Who hurt you Anthony?
i bet my mom is gonna love this album
OOOH I LOVE MY WIFE
Chance the Husband
No one:                   Chance the rapper: AgH!!
Sooo glad we actually agree on something
Come on man 0 maybe a 6
BONE THUGS!! 🤙🏾
0/10? god damn. You just wanted to make that pun didn't you.
*insert the same 3 words repeated 2 times, and then scream a little*
He's going to a collab album with Kanye next year and you will give it a 10
Tbh I was gonna give it a 6 but as I kept listening it dropped to a 4
You look like Logic's older brother Knowledge
half way through the video i realised how much he looks like Stewie griffin and started dying😂
Oooooh I love my wiiiiiife
Review The Sailor
I thought the most of the album was great
Ive never noticed how much Anthony looks over his glasses when he talks 😂😂
I feel like it was rushed and could have been a classical album If Chance had given it more time but I love  some of the Ideas he had.
Wow 0 . Lmao wow woooooooooooow 
Wow 
I’m fucking dying
was this album released as a joke 😐
This album gave me a headache.
Best review yet
Praise jesus, god, and my wife
Kanye and tune yards collaborate at gun point is an album we all need now
CAN YOU PLEASE DO A REVIEW ON RICH BRIAN’S “THE SAILOR”. I give it a light 6 but i would love to hear your opinion!
You should pull a lil nas x and remix this video with guest features shitting on TBD to keep on trending
I havent seen a single comment defending this album
Chance has a different flow, he wouldn't sing it like that
I always thought he was wack
I'd wear that flannel... and I would make it look good...
facts
Review B Boys Dudu, please and thanks.
I like the Nick Cave record in the back.
At least the album cover looks nice.
maxo kream next please!!!!
Yo he went in lmao lmao
Review Devin Townsend - Empath
Ha hahaha hahaha Hahaha
Wait, what? CocoRosie?
Bruh my step brother loves this album and hates IGOR.
Alright alright this just didn’t deserve a 0
Town on the Hill one of the nicest songs of the year tho
Have you done a review of Goldlink's Diaspora?
im a big fan...………………….………………………...of this is the plan
hope you bring that back 
I have a elvis cover called Don't hope you get to hear it Anthony x) peace
The album is very Good. Y’all are tripping.
Chance caught whatever desiese logic got after incredible true story
Gish Gallop in a music review. heh
fresh
chance the rapper voice my wife
Do rich Brian’s album
Heard what you said about NF... I dare you to check out his music in The Search album.
You have to be married to get the real album guys.
Is this the Movie 43 of albums?
So you like it or nah, Ant?
I liked the Gucci track.
Bro chance definitely cheating on his wife
DO THE SAILOR BY RICH BRIAN DUDE, OR I'LL COME TO YOUR HOUSE TO HUG YOU
Keep letting this new Kanye influence you and you get trash like this. This was the worse Chance I've ever heard.
😂😂😂 77 minutes of ur life wasted.
Im going back to Acid Rap and Coloring Book, see you guys
I like the part where Anthony says he hates minorities and drops the n word
You look like you're really enjoying this..
I think he was so disappointed. Do you need to talk, Anthony?
more like small day
Anyone else skipped to the end to see his score?
holy shit you went innnnnnn.


chance is and always will be corny. :/ thats a damn shame too
Chance is an industry plant
Manic Candid Episode bý the Murlocs
nope this review is nitpicking and bias, i win, bye bye.
I generally don't like when artists get famous because they aren't as hungry.

The only caveat is when they become more musical. Because even if the meaning isn't there, at least they're experimenting with sounds. Like Anderson .Paak or the late Mac Miller. Also Gambino. But yeah, it's a shame to see Chance make such empty music.
Do you think you made him cry?
Chance fell so Noname could rise
Damn Sothany Sadtano. I think you're being a lil bit harsh on this album. If you just listen to it without the expectations of expecting bars, it's an ok album. I'd give it a 5 out of 10
More like hot garbage! Hahaha
i liked it for what it was.
It’s cancer👍🏻
RICH BRIAN DO RICH BRIAN
😴
Anthony’s bars at the end of this video were better than anything on this new chance album
I mean, the album wasn't the best, but a *0* out of 10 it's kinda radical. It seems that l'm the only one who liked it
some songs did bang
The transition sounded like a chance song, but good.
Yea his album is trash on his part but the beat and features are good
Really don’t agree with melon on this one.
I know it's petty but whoever made the album cover should be fired. Every time I see it I get pissed. It's a CD with gems on it so I get it.....I think.....but aesthetically it sucks.
What yall talk8ng about this album is bether then Eminem Rivival..
To be fair, I give it an unironic 3
Kanye we need your help
Haha hahaha lmao had to click just to comment this dude sole the chipmunks
I liked roo
7 you really gave damn a damn!!!! I'm sorry I haven't been here in awhile
Oh no. Chance has reached peak Dad.
Okay what's the problem of them giving props to the most high using the word booyah! Do you hate God or something bro no subscribe
I'm not sure if you know this but...

HE LOVES HIS WIFE
Wow, 2 good videos in a year, must be a new record, dude, keep it up.
Where is the NF The Search Review?
Chance The Crapper. OK, too easy, I'll see myself out.
this was real shit
Acid Rap still his best
Lil Mosey: Freshman of the year I woke up like the man

Fantano: *WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SIMILIES?!*
Hot shower
Divorce album finna be lit
Damn that means Fantano thought Jaden had a better album than Chance this year
Logic: im black
Chance: im married
Do NF
HE PULLED OUT THE RED     F  L  A  N  N  E  L     WITH A    S  T  A  I  N
Big gay
An analysis of this review reveals how close Fantano was to literally murdering his entire family
Professor is a basketball player
This album sounds like it was High School Musical presents Chance the Rapper
should we expected anything different?? 

the album was so bad I formed my own opinion b4 the review dropped lmao
I’m still waiting for him to have something positive to say about smino
This is chances revival lmao
Technically speeding bullet to heaven got a better rating than this piece of trash.
Man i hate that chances album is considered bad, i havent heard but almost everyone agrees its bad... smh i hope this isnt the end of chance
Anthony I understand you didnt like the album but calling him "Chance The Cotton-Picker" was over the top.
how dare you disrespect the flannel
Sad to see how far Chance has fallen since Acid Rap. I’m not even interested in hearing new music from him at this point ;(
Dude, listen to the new Showbiz Milano album, “Boulevard Author.” So much better than virtually all hip hop or rap you review. Seriously, peep it. You may not relate, but for those who grew up in ghettos and appreciate the art of hip hop, it’s a contender for top album of 2019. You’d up your cred big time if you give it some light. My 14 yo son (huge Fantano fan) even loves it.
Let's Agree: Melon had better bars about the The Big Day than the actual album
Bladee > Chance
That's references to Andre 3 Stacks stupid
“I love my wifeeeeee, i ride a bike with my wifeeeeee, we love riding bikesssss, with my wifeeeeee” ~Chance
Chance the Rapper's own Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven.





Glorious.
"Chances jokes fail to execute"

"I understand the image on the album cover cause I can see right through this bs"
What’s the difference between a 0/10 and a “NOT GOOD”?
POINT BLANK PERIODT
Who else was mad disappointed in this album?
I liked this a lot better than his previous mostly because there's more rapping on it. But it's way to long
No more Chicken Sandwiches...
Yes, I'll pay for the damages...
Red flannel time
I’m a huge Chance stan and I hated TBD and agreed with everything in this review. I did find it funny Fantano didn’t understand the The Professor line. Lol The Professor is a pretty famous streetball guy who never “went pro” that was actually one of the like 7 lines I actually liked
We lost Chance once he became a brand and started doing KitKat advertisements🤦🏿‍♂️
Chance wife not attractive
Whats the worst song on the album? I wanna have a good laugh
But Antknee! Did you know Chance is married???
As much as I love chance I agree with this
Des-Tiny got gishgalloped in this debate.
Dayum
I wanted to hear more about his marriage
Hot water hot wife hot shower
I think you should review ‘The Sailor’ next
is this the first zero
DAMN. album unworthy for a NOT GOOD review
10/10 this album has a little something for everyone in my special ed class. You are just being nitpicky and biased. I win. Bye bye.
Thus album was STRAIGHT TRASH.
I just would like to remind everyone that Pitchfork gave it 6.9/10
THIS IS A DISAPPOINTING REVIEW MELON, THIS IS A GREAT RECORD
The Infinity Flannel?!?!?! 
Melon is gonna snap Chance outta Existence
“he sounds like Bon Iver’s less talented cousin, Don Iver” Lmaooo
This shit ready be funny..
no one:

chance: OOHOHOHHHHH MY WIFE IS THE BEST IN THE WOOOORLD THIS IS THE WORST SONG YOUVE EVER HEAAAARD 
I HAVE A DAUGHTER OOHHH DID I TELL YALL THAT I LOVE MY WIFE TOO??  
I LOVE MY KID AND WIFE THOSE GIRLS ARE MY LIFEE OHOHOOHH
I been thought chance fell off his voice went from interesting too annoying he sounds like he's trying too immitate a baby voice..
I don’t think I seen any video of his where he dropped a zero but I agree that album was ass
Thanks melon! Out of panic I almost told people I liked this album but thanks to your fast work I was able quickly have my opinion.😃
You know you’ve failed as an artist when carti’s baby voice makes more sense than your lyrics
Kanye Curse
He actually threw his Phone 😂😂
Alright alright this just didn’t deserve a 0
Redthony Flannelo means badthony scoretano
After I heard this I was so disappointed I had to go back to acid rap to remind myself  how good he was
Twenty-two songs and the only two I enjoyed were Slide Around and Big Fish. Even then the beat went harder than anything Chance said.




Drugs > Marraige
Back when him and childish gambino were trippin acid everyday it was the best times
FIRST ZERO SINCE SPEEDIN BULLET TO HEAVEN BABY
This hurt, but I agree. I miss chi city chano but I guess everyone grows up.
5:39 - WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SIMILES? When you being the Aldi-brand version of Lil Wayne.
Hot Shower is just a fun track but everybody too serious fah shit like that, i guess.
we need a “the sailor” review
Chance ain't independent, not with all the features and relevancy in general. Dude's a goddamn plant
Uh oh he’s wearing the red shirt
I like the album a lot. It's pretty fun to sing along. Especially found a good one stuck with me.
This album makes me miss my cancer.
now I know kanye a lost man because he approved of the album enough to not stop chance from putting it out
looks like that line "I met kanye west im never going to fail" didnt really pan out
maybe Chance should've retired from music after Acid Rap
The Tool album review will make me laugh so hard.
Cant wait for the kanye collab to be a 10
Ok, album as a whole: TrAsH
But some stand out songs:
Do you remember 
Eternal
Let’s go one the run
Get a bag
I agree, that this album is bad but you didn't have to sacrifice a baby lamb on camera to ressurect the original klu klux Klan
Love him or hate him, he is speaking facts here!
In the most respectful way, you look like a Thumb/Steve-o hybrid.
STRONG "0" LOL DAMN LOL 😂⭕📢
Wim Hoff breathing method changed my life forever and can yours too!
😂 “then there’s the track Hot Shower...more like Hot Garbage”- 🍈 *Melon*
You gonna review that Cordae album? Pretty damn good. 

Btw I love when you give albums terrible reviews. You can feel the resentment that you even have to review it 😂 Get some pretty good roasting from you
11:30 I now see why this album is clear. Because I see right through this BS.   LOL OMG
Waiting on that The Lost Boy album review! Haha
1/10...🗑. Btw, YBN Cordae The Lost Boy Review should be next!
I’m not subscribed to you, I tell Youtube I’m not interested every time I see your videos, and yet they’re still appearing in my feed. WHY
Love your vids! When are you going to review Jacob Collier's albums from this year? He's got two Grammys for jazz arranging and he's putting out 4 full length albums this year.
*”KIT KAT SALES REP”*
I’ve never been more sad than having to agree with melon😥
The intro almost put me to sleep
Oh I love my wife,I love my wife AH!
Damn... a 0
I really enjoyed the Cal exchange at the end. Thanks, Melon.
One of the biggest issues with this album is the length, 77 minutes is just too much. Just a example that came to me: Metallica's last album was not bad by any means, but it was too damn long, so the B side was much worse than te A side. This one has more bad songs, but it isn't pure shit, if the album was shorter and some of the most horrible songs were cut off, it would be a little bit better.
To save me time of watching every one of this guy's reviews, what albums are his favorite? I wanna know what type of music and bars someone this sarcastic likes (he's funny tho).
Review Skizzy Mars’ “Free Skizzy”
nicki minaj was the best feature on this amazing album so don't @ me sleeze on it !!!!
i love my wife AAH!
Damn it I liked this album, *now I can't like it anymore*
Omg almost 2M subs!!🤠
Ooh I love my wife AGH
Please review Rich Brian's The Sailor!! :)
my favorite review yet.
“Then we have the track hot shower..... more like HOT GARBAGE” .... I died 😂
Acid rap was the pinnacle for me.
that line about his grandma was pretty hard
Woah did that just happen lol
MY EYESSSS🤢
I actually agree with you💀.
Review Cordaes new project!!
i think you have a stain on your shirt my guy
Melon actually did it lmao
Iam still waiting u react  new album rich Brian 🙌
Damn a 0 sheesh lmao
Stack overflow chance actually got a 255/10 making it anthonys highest rated album
I love my wife *AAH*
I saw this coming after all the singles he released after coloring book, I mean I didn't want to believe it but I just felt like the dude was somewhere other than where he was if you get what I'm saying. This is quite sad though😞
Dude is this the second ever 0/10??
Shouldn't this be a a NOT GOOD vid?
I knew this would happen as soon as I saw that Doritos commercial.
You should do a review for NF new album
Honestly I’ve just started listening to music regularly after realizing I actually enjoyed it as opposed to when I believed it wasn’t for me. I’ve found I love artist like Tyler, Joji, Aries, Rich Brian, and a few others. Should I even give this album a listen even if it shit
review classic albums!!
Some parts on this album were actually hard to listen to. So disappointing.
Oh man.. I just went to listen to "Found a good one" and it started out sounding like a ... demo.. then someone rushed in some production, and then for a second with the bass I was like  "alright, this isn't THAT bad". Yeah, this is the only song I've heard since the first track and .. wow, he really under delivers compared to what I'm used to (which is Acid Rap, which I really fucking enjoyed), then puts a little more effort in, and then goes way into it.

Still, I'm used to tracks I hate often flipping to be ones that are my favorite. .. I don't know if that's going because my own reaction sort of sold me out when I went " aaahhhehhhhhhhh.... *nothing*" and then realized the sound I had made was like an audio reputation of anthony.. uhh.. slimepawing his face at 4:08. I'm still going to finish it and give it more chancs but I will say that this dumb story is so far more memorable than the song itself for me right now so ....... When's Pardison Fontaine going to do drop an album?
Negative Space - new Swain album please
Y'all stupid this album is a banger the more I listen to it the more I love it.
Lol I love honesty
I thought it was pretty good
here from the future after chance puts a hit on melon man
Speedin bullet to heaven > the big day 😂😂😂
So the “NOT GOOD” is silent?
fav tracks: N/A - i died haha
I'm boutta book a show at the Dimmesdale Dimmadome is the best bar of 2019 😤😤🔥
Good one melon I agree with you this time
When you the ultimate industry plant but your team forgot to pay out one important person before you drop
no fireworks?
The Lost Boy by YBN Cordae?
MARRY ME CAL
Acid rap is a strong 8 imo
I been wonderin why Apple Music has been promotin him (Chance) super hard for the last month, I see him on there every single time I open it
Review trust no 1 by d savage
Lmao at the screencap
Melon! Give chance another chance to chance ok!
How this get 1 million views like how
Sum parts I thought he was young thug🚮
get emmmmm
#40 on trending lmao
Will he go to shadow realm?
Whos Chance ( TooL dropping on Aug 30th)
Sooooooooo......it’s “not good”
6:49
2 albums dropped in the same day and you decided to do Chance???? Trashhhhhhh
6:49 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
Don’t let this distract you from Chance being married.
Review Chris Browns Album indigo.
When a debut project from one of the most talented rappers right now peforms worst then Playboy Carti "die lit", whitch is like, a bunch of cool sounds and ideas + a lot of adlibs. Its actually kinda funny. Fantano give carti project a solid 7 for those who don't remember.
FARTHONY SMELLTANO
Unfortunately this "debut" album from what used to be my favorite artist is much more of a concept album (not a good one either like Childish Gambino's funk album) and far less of a breakout debut album from an artist we all already know and love. Sadly if this were the first we had heard from Chancellor, his name wouldn't be what it is today. All of his mixtapes are 1000% better than this "album". I shouldn't have to force myself to like music, even one track, from an artist I already love and respect....
I haven't heard the album yet but damn 😂 
I strongly disagree with your review of KRIT's new album. It's a strong 7, light 8 easy.
But it seems like literally EVERYONE agrees with you on this one.
Imma still check it out though lol
Do you guys think chance has a wife?
He hit his revival stage already
Is there another 0/10 he gave or is the exceptionally bad
YES
He’s just as bad as ever
Grabbing my flannel for this guys funeral as well
Ok first of all daddy long legs have 6 legs
Why this dude looks like a failed logic version 10000
man just ended chance's career
The salt in this comment section is delicious
LMAOOOO  the album wasnt that bad
those puns are modern eminem level corny
review dum and dummer
Lol 0!!!!
Chance’s career followed Kanye and then he realized he couldn’t make 808’s and heartbreak because he has a wife.
As big of a chance fan I am, I have to begrudgingly agree with most of this review.. instrumentally it was a lot of interesting ideas that just didn't come together under lackluster and lazy raps
My latest album was better. 😁
There it is
I thought I was weird for not liking it
MR melon you should give him another chance
Acidic rap basic marriage experience.
Chance is not the same but it is clear as day he’s going over your head.
When is the rich brian review??????
Idk who we trying to kid....chance was never that good
Chance about to team up with kanye and put out Kids See Ghost 2
Do you think he loves his wife
For a kidz bop album it’s not bad
cant believe im saying this
but
i
dont
disagree
this
shit
was
cheeks
Fantano... Who paid you for this shill?
Can you review the sailor by rich brian? You might be surprised
I hope Chance sees this and actually takes the criticism somewhat seriously. I love his music, but come on, man. This sucked
Do the sailor melon
You bodied Chano!
can you do a review on some of the Australian drill rap (more specifically western Sydney rap), it's pretty great and I think it does not get enough global recognition. (people like hooligan hefs, one four, 21 district)
Yo Melon just snapped on Chance the Kit Kat salesman with that infinity flannel
From someone who was bumping AcidRap every day during freshman year when it dropped, I can’t say I enjoyed this album. Like at all. I thought I’d like it at least a little even if I knew it wasn’t going to be another 10 Day or AcidRap, but god damn. It fucking sucks. 
Needless to say, he was not even better than the last time baby
This album was garbage juice ... -5/10
Apologize to Because The Internet now
At least “Speeding Bullet To Heaven” was somewhat interesting and hilarious.
I listened to half the album... it’s a lot damn tracks and they are fire 🔥 you’re full of 💩🥴 dumtano! We go high, Do you remember 🔥! He doesn’t record in an immature manner anymore, he has a daughter and a culture to raise! Genius! “They don’t take Teenage Angst at no banks”! Period!
“Hot shower more like hot garbage “ had me dead 😂
Am I seeing this right, that's a ZERO OUT OF TEN. Oh dear I guess I'll listen to ERYS instead.
technically he just rated this lower than Speedin’ Bullet to Heaven according to the descriptions




how did Chance flop so badly like this
This is chances revival
This guy is absolutely James Spader
Chance the Public Entertainer
With those bars, he’s gonna be doing commercials for a while.
This album was just not for me
Why is Jason Derulo in Fortnite??????
The second I saw him post. "My wife gave me permission to finish the album!" I knew where this was going...
Shoulda got a 10 for the Doug Dimmadome reference alone.
Still can't believe you called Smino a "Chance Clone" ....
Give Smino a chance Melon
Honeslty i dont know how people like logic. Only people I can see playing hsi music is depressed lesbians. Post malone the goat
Disappointed.
Chance ruined Doritos for me
As someone who waited 3 years for an album, I speak on the behalf of chance fans that this was a little letdown.
gg.
This album is like the anti -A Crow Looked At Me. Opposite sides of the "I love my wife" spectrum
idk why he be hatting on the album and calling his bars lame when he didnt even listen to it and just read the lyrics like my dude litsen to it before you be bashing it like sleeze on ittttt !!!!
Crazy this who y’all run to for hip hop opinion
The Big F
As if the cover art wasn't cringe enough.
"Chance the rapper breaks boundaries by being a black man who stays with his wife."
That was kinda screwed up Antee.
Chance always been corny to me so it’s no surprise.
3:58 
when you come home late and your dog starts barking
"FAV TRACKS: n/a"
yooo hahahahahah
Terrible Bon Iver joke. Keep being the skip bayless of music. Bad reviews for clicks. All you are. And we both are from CT. Sad
Peppa pig had a better album lmao.
Hope chance pulls a kid cudi and gets a 10 later
Anthony grows stronger with every bad album review. Soon the infinity flannel will be dawned.
That Marianne Williamson guest appearance really spiced up the review. Thanks Melon!
The sailor needs to be reviewed because I really can’t put anything else on but that album
Such a flop
1:42 So the YBN Cordae album review is definitely incoming.
Honestly loved Chances whole discography before this album but Melon is right this album is sloppy af
NF the search
Lmao this man got a straight up GOOSE EGG! at least Cudi got a decimal
I love watching his reviews because it reminds me that what I think is good is actually really bad
You really need to review YBN Cordae - The Lost Boy album
This album was trash
Hey, at least the mixing and mastering was pretty good
this is unnecessarily critical of the wordplay. is there this level of critique with every other hip-hop artist? no possible way. there were some legitimately great lines, some of which are better than most other rappers could ever deliver. We Go High had some amazing lyrics among others. Some of the lines he said were wack were actually not at all.


Hot Shower was bad though in terms of lyrics, though. I'll cede that.
If only lil nas x gave chance an old town road remix this album wouldve been a 10
Chance must have employed Cal Chuchesta as a ghostwriter for this album.
I'm not feeling very married to this album
Ooo I love my wife, I love my wife (AH)
Let’s go ride a bike, with my wife (AH)

My wife’s really young, my wife’s pretty small
Let’s go to the beach and play with a beach ball
Praise Jesus Christ and my wife
Let’s go to the beach and ride a bike

Ooo I love my wife, I love my wife (AH)
Ooo I love my wife, she is so fine (AH)
Had fun at the party last night Melon, thanks for the ride home!
Chance : Here's my project, I put lot of efforts in it...

Melon : Say sike right now.
Nobody: 

Chance The Rapper: Do you know, I’m married !?
Man I completely disagree. I 100% love chance using multiple genres to inspire. You either feel his love through his music or not. Period.
Melon snapped the real album out of existence. That's why the cover art is blank
Agree
Its sad how the worse part about the chance the rapper album was chance the rapper
Damn first 10\10 in a while
Biggest positive is most of the comments are about the album and not just memes.

The album is trash totally agree with the 0 did not even good enough for a "not good"
I had google Chance's wife to see if she was worth this flop. 



She ain't
Y'all should have seen this coming after the Super Bowl Doritos commercial with the Backstreet Boys.
The Infinity Flannel tho. One day I hope he actually wears it. Then his true power will be unleashed.
Once I head the single “GRoCERIES” I knew we weren’t going to get the Acid Rap Chance back anytime soon. 😭
Broke: I’m biracial
Woke: I love my wife!!!
The Kit Kat Merchant vs The Ridge Wallet Salesman
Don Iver 😂😂I’m weak. Melon is mad,  bro stop gritting your teeth and keep flossing
Colouring book was produced very well I don't know how he went from that to this
Anthony did you really have to say you’re “glad his friend got stabbed”??
Sooooooo we’re just gonna ignore the fact that this man said “ain’t no diamonds in the chain but it’s independent”
No lie the infinity flannel is kinda hot.
pls review rich brian - the sailor album
It's called Hot Shower because it'll make you want to take one after listening to it
I didnt kniw logic reviewed albums
Would love to hear your thoughts on the new MGK project...
Why so melancholy? Oh--nvm lol He just went through a torture chamber.
"Chance~s biggest mistake was dropping an album the same year as Peppa. No one can compete." --Bowser
9:30 you're welcome
Chance had the audacity to talk about ye’s music when this is what he had in store for us
9:56 Justin Vernon has credits for writing and producing on this
Please review Ybn cordae's lost boy,Asap! 🙌🏾 I have to hear what you've got to say about it.
ballin flossin was the best song on there
up next: chance joins a rap duo with some other rapper and makes a 10/10 album
Lmao at the end. Accurate review.
Could’ve seen this coming with tracks like All Night on his last project. It’s like he wants to make original and inspired work but has a corny tick.
Kit Kat sales rep, give me a break 😂😳😂
Yooo that’s what I was thinking! It’s like chance released a Macklemore album.
but seriously, if this isn’t proof that the big music game changes you then I don’t know what is. Being famous really fucks up your music, label or no label
Can your review “The Search” by NF?
A 10? Wow lemon, never tought this album was like kids see ghost! :o
This might as well be a Not Good if it had the right qualifications.
Do Cordaes album
I peep that Murder Ballads record. Such a great album.
Been waiting for you to tear this album a new one
Wow his eyes are so far away from his lips 🤣
Thank you melon for keeping me safe from listening to this album. 🙏🙏🙏
Well at least now we know in a few albums Chance will get a perfect 10
I LOVE MY WIFEEEEE
Why wasn't this a NOT GOOD?! I want some explosions!
I honestly thought it was wack and it was a waist of time ... I would have liked two separate albums and a better concept
fukin review Hot Chip's new album already
Review YBN Cordae’s album next please
Review NF's The Search album
Yeah Im surprised you still have the best teeth in the game, Fantano, considering you've endured so much cringe up til now
When he gonna talk about his wife?
I ran through the album and I don’t plan on going back... but YBN Cordae... his album is amazing!
damn anthony a million in a day
“Smoking green, cauliflower” 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I love the flamming lips
0/10 omg
you snapped
5:13 thats the only so bad it's good line...
0/10 XD
...but i liked the album
What’re the albums in the back
Amma keep disliking your vids up until you review Rich Brian’s album The Sailor. Do it goddamnit.
At least you get paid to listen to this. I had to get ear surgery after
Someone rename this album from The Big Day to The Big Oof
Wow
This review is like a kiss on the head before bed
A strong 0 😭
Damn and I thought I was being a hater.
I really like the song Roo
I wish it was all just Melon reading lyrics.
This is gonna be the new MBDTF
my mans reviews chance the rapper in a milisecond but still hasnt reviewed my boy rich brian.
Haha I really liked the album...weird
I didn’t listen to all of it but the couple tracks I listened to were cute
review cordaes album
Guy threw his phone 😂😂
this review is OD, I didn't like the Disney-rap feel but I thought Chance pen was still dope on this
I enjoyed the album. Smino was snapping.
Ilovethony Mywifetano
Chance dropped his own speeding bullet to heaven. Now hes gonna go drop a 10 with Kanye
lol. You trippin’
Damn I can't listen to some one verbally explain a review of an album . It really sucks that YouTube has made it annoying as f to actually listen to a review , your basically listening to a podcast about music you can't hear.
I got love for chances mixtapes but yeah the album god awful, dude dropped a snippet of a song called #1 dubplate about 2 years ago and shit was fire but it’s not on the album
I'm not gonna check this album out, because it's falling below my normal reviewer threshold even discounting this review, but I did get a laugh out of the lyrics you listed, especially the Dimmesdale Dimmedome reference.
Wow! Nice trick melon. Changing to yellow flannel midway!!
Can you review mgks hotel Diablo!
The Fantano curse might be severe this time
You going to review the NF The search  album?
what the HELL, are these similes?
This hit one million faster than Chance hit us with that pippy long-stocking line
Hahahahaha
But Handsome is hella catchy actually. Gonna be a club banger
w0w!
Also if we being honest we shoulda seen this coming after he went from acid Rap to “3” and his other projects it’s only downhill from here
YBN CORDAE NEXT!!!
Fantano used mind crush on Chance and sent him with Bones to the Shadow Realm
I could not believe what you said about this album until I, out of pure interest, listened to THAT part in the title track, god damn that shit is out of touch
I honestly liked the album...
Logic: I’m biracial
Chance The Rapper: I love my wife
Giorno Giovanna: I have a dream
Famous Dex: Hoes Mad
WOW.
Maybe the drugs he used to make the last albums rotted his brain.
The album cover is so poetic clear disc... absolutely nothing here
IT'S A 0
IT'S A 0
DAM BOI HEEES THICCCCC
Just sayin this album is extremely fire and idc what anyone says
Pls do Rich Brians Sailor album pls
Hot shower was hilarious lol.
Melon is lookin thiccer then ever in this vid
6:50 😂😂😭😭
Hip hop is falling apart.
How do your wife and 7 kids feel about sharing a home with Cal?
Trending squad
so how about that rich brian album melon
How about rich Brian album
*I N F I N I T Y  F L A N N E L*
Why in the name of the lord did you not review Berman’s comeback under the Purple Mountains moniker?! Seriously! Unbelievable album that needs more attention.
Mr.BestTeethInTheGodDamnGame, do Tool god damnit. We all know their discography is being put on streaming services and their new album is gonna drop in August SO I KNOW damn well YOU GOTTA do it. Otherwise your teeth will be placed in second in the game. Bro.
TRENT THE HOOLIGAN - MEDUSA ALBUM
So you not gunna review the maxo kream album
I hate to agree with him for this one :/ I was really hoping when this would drop it was really gonna be The Big Day....but damn he’s right
The album is a mess
Please review 'The Search' by NF
Is this the first 0/10?. I thought he normally just writes 'not good' when it's really bad
Ive never listened to Chance da rapper and now I don’t think I will
I did big like this after a single listen. But 0. Wow! Maybe it is a Disney soundtrack as I thought
i really want to buy an infinity flannel now
Has anyone ever gotten a zero before
Are you gonna do Rich Brians The Sailor
The Bad Day ;(
somehow every time i watch you review albums you hate them, am i choosing the wrong videos or do you not like music
Ya his album wasn’t good
Anthony who made that flannel?
CHEK OUT TRENT THE HOOLIGAN MEDUSA ALBUM
You better be wearing that multicolor flannel on your next video Melon.
wow is there anything good about this record???
That was harsh but 1M% accurate. I have to give it a light to decent zero though; because he is Chance.
Anthony just read my mind and put it on video sorry chance this album is garbage.
oh man.
I agree. Album was garbage 🗑
Chance is the new logic
can you review NF - The Search
Worse than COADM?! Wow
Least it wasn't a week 0
The reason the CD on the cover is clear with diamonds is because it's absolutely nothing except for a few awful bits that rise above garbage level
Bigger THAN Diddy Kong
I always come here to see what it looks like when, SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE CULTURE HAS AN OPINION!!! 

CLUELESS YOU ARE SIR!
Gtfo
Whats the difference between a strong 0 and a NOT GOOD?
In all honestly is this album intentionally shitty.
Chance was my first ever “favorite rapper” now I cringe when I hear his name
"Coloring Book" would have made a better album than TBD. THIS should have been an EP/Mixtape.
Ya got some tall ass teeth bruh
Windows his best song to me tbh.
its a vibe
Chance may be a decent Kit Kat sponsor , but he isn’t a top tier minimalist wallet sponsor like my boi Annie Bannanie!
Bro just make a not good
A milli in a day
yeah we know that this album was bad melon but did you really have to tell us you had a little something with his wife
anthony when are you dropping the IGOR review, it was funny at first but now im actually starting to really want it
Acid rap is one of my favorite projects ever. Makes me sad :(
Playboi Carti latest project 7/10 
Chance latest 0/10 and they laughed at me when i said lord cartier is better than Pac.
This album literally sounds like a compilation of worst Kanye West's songs
Chance: I love my wife
Stans: GOAT
To think Miley Cyrus released a better album than Chance the Rapper this year
Any producer not Kanye:

Anthony: This is just a rip off of Kanye🤓
The Big day, more like the BIG L
When you manage to get a worse score than logic, it speaks volumes.
Ppl hate to hear about god..
turned it off after the 3rd song as i realized my eyes were literally closed. thank u for your sacrifice., melon
Chance’s verse on YBN Cordae’s album that dropped same day is better than anything on his own album.
Chance just honestly disappointed me in this album bruh. Wtf is this ...
Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven>The Big Day
Why give it a 0 instead of just a not good?
Chance gonna pull a Kid Cudi in 4 years
My next tour, it got eight legs, like daddy long
_The Big Day_
_The Lost Boy_
_The Sailor_
_The Search_
what's with _the_ word _"the"_ in _the_ year 2019?
*_The Heck?_*
Ya'll notice this album's cover wasnt Psychedelic like Acid Rap, Coloring Book.. What a coincidence..
Diddy Combs😑😑😑
Chance really was feeling safe dropping this album after the logic album, but my god this is so worse.
I know this meme is outdated but

Me: hey mom can we have kanye?
Mom: no we have kanye at home

Kanye at home:
Chance is a hit or miss rapper who I thought was hyped up. His best shit was not acid rapper it was good enough and back to school mixtape. Before he over did the cringy voice.
Chance just got kid cudied

Now prepare for that 10/10
How can I take this seriously after the MBDTF review? 

Sorry Melon, this album truly did it for me. Maybe I’m the only one.
Da Baby, Megan Thee Stallion, Nicki Minaj were the highlights.
Chance becoming the Adam Sandler of the music industry
I liked it. It’s not music to listen by yourself. It’s music to dance and party to.
This guy is Lowkey the worst
Huge Chance fan here... owlbum was trash. Bye
This album sucked
Big fish get the bag and the song w lil durk and Nicki are cool
Broo why is this trending but

"I love my wife" isn't
Please review NFs new album
Damn 😭😭 this review making me feel guilty for even enjoying the album
Chance been garbage....
You better be wearing the infinity flannel on your next 10, melon man.
I would love to see some cal reveiws in the infinity flannel
yeah this is really bad react to brockhamptons I BEEN BORN AGAIN now!!
Anthony please don’t kill another rapper you’ve already taken so many
Wow wearing a red shirt and giving it a 9? Interesting.
Only liked Sun Come Down and Big Fish.
I’m still underwhelmed w/ knowing that u sit instead of stand during your reviews. I honestly wish I never found out.
Lyrics don’t make up the entire song. It’s called a vibe.
Me: Oh, a new Chance album




Chance: DID YOU KNOW IM MARRIED
There are some songs I like but 22... No. A LOT of these songs weren't necessary and didn't add anything to the work. Those skits are awful. I wanted so much better
It’s not that bad guys
Bruh I LOVE this album. No clue what yall are talking about
I love chance sooo much but that “hug and hug and hug you” part was terrible lol. And yeah he waited wayyyy to long to release something like this. Every track should be a banger. But my fav song is “eternal” I love smino. But a lot of this shit is kinda annoying. It’s sad !
Yup, yerp

Dude, I just called the plug and his phone was unplugged
I was lookin' at Doug like "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Dude, that shit don't even make no fucking sense
Like having fuckin' arguments for payin' 50 extra cents for barbecue
Saucing on the workers at McDonald's
I don't wanna sit and argue, Good Burger shoulda taught you
We all dudes
And I'm all professional and proper

She said we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two seater (okay, question)
Am I still considered a jerk 
If I get her a hoopty and buy me a Beamer? (Uh-uh)
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out
My lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence
When they critique my demeanor (Ha)
Today I just signed to Republic (What else?)
