Most rappers out here dissin each other while Kanye be dissin the devil
All jokes aside, this is fire no cap
1) you don't have to be religious to like the song
2)you're not being forced to convert to Christianity because of a song, quit being so pressed.
3)This beat goes hard
I’m not religious but this song is a banger.
In 10 years people gonna be like “masterpiece”
42 years to realize his daddy was his best friend. 

God can do anything!
"He told me, It ain't Christ like , but nobody never tell you when you been Christ like"  people will keep reminding you of your sins until you forget you have a Good part.
One of the most underrated and hardest Kanye songs
Believing in Jesus is not a religion, it’s a Kingdom. A kingdom we can’t see, the kingdom of heaven. That’s why we call Him the king
Who entered January 2021 with this
everybody gangsta till Kanye and his dad pull up with the JesusTank™️
2 minutes? This ain't very christ like.
Kayne is without a doubt of of the most talented artists to come out of America.
Whoever said Christian can’t SLAP needs to see this
Kanye was right when he said that loving his music was loving yourself.
Kanye has had the most diverse career timeline of hip hop ever.
If you confess with your tongue that Jesus is Lord and you believe that the father raised him from the dead you will be saved.
I love this aesthetic. It feels like being home on a cold Saturday morning
This brought tears to my eyes. I lost my dad in a really painful way more than a year ago but I already knew he was my best friend. Ever. Can't express how much I miss him. He didn't get to meet my 4-months old son. Can't express how much I miss him. Long live Jose Bello.
So glad the Lord saved Kanyes soul, he didn't let his talent go to waste.
Who said Christian music can't slap.
It’s never to late to follow God and read the Bible 🙏 God bless you all
I buried my father in 2009,  never met the man, but  I still paid for his  funeral.
This song is great, cant believe it has so many dislikes.
I love Jesus!
Remember kids, Follow God.
Im so glad kanye west changed more rappers who selled their soul should realise god is powerful
@KanyeWestVEVO ain’t crazy he’s just conscious of what’s going on.  He wide awake, but when he tried to tell y’all what’s really going on it’s easier to label him as crazy cuz y’all still sleeping. He just figured it out.
Many people think he crazy but he starting to tell whats really going on. The gov and higher ups making him seem crazy ass hell, pay attention to him and those they call terrorist in america. You'll see some mind blowing things
Jimmy Kimmel: "are you a Christian artist now?"

Kanye: "I am a Christian everything now!" :O
who’s here after kim wants a divorce
I feel like the perfect example for Kanye is “when God told Noah to build the ark people thought he was ‘crazy’” and they all drowned so we should listen to Kanye and sure he might not make much sense but he has good ideas
this is one of kanye’s best songs.
He replied with 3 words: ''A black man?'' - this actually made me so emotional, to see how differetn generations are used to dividing wealth between races, and not between humans. We are living in a revolution.
This is the intro for Runaway (Full length) 😂
Now hes messing with jeffree star
This tune is absolute class! And no, I'm not religious.
Repent and trust in Christ if you wanna get to heaven
Imagine if your church just busts out this song...
"I took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend "
 
😢
This is still one of my favorite songs, 
coming from a muslim.
1:29 he really got the Rune Zhaba irl what kind of DLCs God makin
Who's here after Joe Rogan name droped Christ like and put this song in yo head
WAP has more views than this masterpiece 

That ain’t christ like
Stoned af never heard this but I feel like god put this on my trip today!! God is Great 👍🏼
Is that his daddy singing in the background if it is he can sing!
*love your god, with all your heart, soul, understanding and strength, and any human you meet, like yourself.*
This song feels like Ortiz feat Jay Z. Masterpiece
Kanye really driving the car I drew as a kid
Vaccine has LUCIFERASE. Dr info indicates it has name made enzyme that is mentioned in Revelation 18. God has warned about this. Please do research. God's people die from lack of knowledge. It can't be undone.
Nah ahhhhhh, nobody can't tell him nothin!!!
He regret selling his soul🙏
"instead of creating your own footprints, walk in the ones I already created"..... Jesus showed us how to live and promise to not abandon us. We are not alone in this world. God is good.
At least he reconnected with his pops, that's whassup
why are they in winter coats there’s 2 inches of snow 😂😂 that’s hoodie weather in canada
I love how his dad he's talking about his kids being very fearful walking on snow and now, they are just cruising on it.
Seeing Kanye in bibs out in the middle if nowhere makes me like him more
This monster car is Chris's gift? 🔥
I do really like the song, even though I’m an atheist. Like it’s just good music I have no reason to be pressed
"A black man?"
"Wrestlin' with God, I dont really wanna wrestle!" Mannnn...BARS! Do you hear me?! They can try they hardest to change Ye but music is in his DNA. That wont change. Music is his soul.
Haha I adore Kanye west. So authentic. We need more of that.
Literally everyone when walking in snow: ima use boots!

Kanye: IMA USE MY JESUS TANK™️
Who else wishes this song was longer!!!!🤗❤🔥
This song and “Clover Cage - Lost Then Found” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together...I love you
Fell off from Kanye when I thought he was crazy , listened to him on Joe rogan, now I’m the crazy one. He just has untouchable confidence and believes in everything he stands for
Us waiting for the comments in *2027* calling this genius 👀
The only negative thing about this song is that it isn’t longer
MORGENSHTERN & Lil Pump - WATAFUK?! (International Hit, 2020)
You have my respect, god bless
Who’s here from that tik tok 👀
thank you god for nature, thank you nature, for god, thank you kanye, for being you ❣️
1:08 me in the shower pretending I’m performing to millions of people 😂
he has a perfect vehicle for zombie apocalypse lol XD!!!
In my opinion:one of the most underrated beats of all time, jus some’ about it
1:24 was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.
Going to 2021 listening to this 🔥
Lil pump: I have the coolest cars in my videos.

Kanye: hold my holy water
God bless you Mr kanye west. I wish I could lay my hands on you and pray for you!
Keep showing them that they don't have to kill/steal/riot to make a difference. You broke the mold and they can too! They just need to turn their backs on sin and hate!
This song and “Clover Cage - Still Hanging On” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times. I just want to send love to everyone and I want everyone to know things will get better. We are in this together..
“Now more than ever it is crucial that you be “watchers of the dawn”,
the lookouts who announce the light of dawn and the new springtime of the Gospel
of which the buds can already be seen.”
—POPE JOHN PAUL II
People sleeping on his dad’s monologue at the start, powerful
Guys, Kanye Wess saved me. I grew up without my dad and he still alive. Ye helped me find closure before this drop. This is the cherry on the cake.

GOD BLESS KANYE WESS
When you finally realize the glee of knowing... your father (or mother) is proud of you...
Larry Dembrun - what a video! During these covid times we all need to remember to laugh a little love a little #larrydemnbrun #2021 #over #hope #newyear #happyagain
When he's rapping facing away from the camera, that shit made me think about how Kanye doesn't want it to be about him. He wants us to follow God, and he's looking at the majesty and beauty that God has made for us. 

It could also be interpreted as we are following him, since we are seeing him from behind, like the pastor's children through the snow. Through his Faith, he is inspiring others to believe and trust God. 

I'm probably reading too much into it, but hey, we don't know the artist's exact intention, so we gotta do our best to interpret the meaning of his work. Anyone else have thoughts?
*I hate likes*
The scream at the end confused the hell out of me when I first listened to this
“People really know you push ya buttons like typewrites” facts 🎶 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You got to love Kanye! Just chilling 'drifting' a sherp in slow mo in snow.
I’m so glad he found Jesus 🙏❤️ Jesus saves
“It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend “
-Kanye West
I'm here for the beat work and flow, perfect as hell! DAMN son!
Just because I’m 11 doesn’t mean that I’m to young to love the Lord with all my heart and soul. Praise the Lord. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
1:53 actual footage of Kanye doing wheelies on the Zeitgeist
love the last slide. recently reconnected with my dad, a beautiful blessing <3
That’s awesome about Kanye’s reunion with his father through the Father.
А всюдихід Український, )
This sounds like a song from the 2010s
1:04 GETTEM YE!!! Glad he happy in hots music rh cuz arty the end of the day that's what matters
His dad should've opened the album with selah in the background
this man really flexing on us doing donuts in a snowmobile on his 4000 acres of land. that view is deadass gorgeous though.
Everyone is you in a different cubic dimension of space time,  I am the last "you" here 💙
This intro & song sincerely touched my heart
Bruh his dads face when they were in that huge vehicle got me laughing🤣
Who’s Here After Jefree Posted A Pic In This Same Exact Spot That Kanye Recorded This Video In🙋🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Other rappers: Lamborghinis, Bugattis and Bentleys
Kanye: Big Wheel Snow thing
"Tell me it ain't christ like"
Is that his dad walking w him and talking in the beginning? My god this song/video touched my soul!!!!!!!!!
"now you wanna see a freak"
" They were fearful in the terms of the steps they would make, and I said to follow the steps that I made" -  In terms of snow.

Kanye treading in the snow in video. 
Dont be afraid.
Props to the cameraman running so fast
Thanks for being a positive light in our lives. Fearless, courageous, and talented. Thank you Brother West.
Fraternity:-kanye booooo, you are bad, vulgar
Meanwhile....
Kanye:- i don't care, im still the richest rapper in world and 21 grammy awards winner😂😂😂😂😂
Christians get to enjoy Kanye finally lol 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️.... y’all have really been missing out
Rappers create Music

Kanye creates ART
Didn’t realize the similarities between this song and Otis until now.
Love the Sherp! Best thing to come out of Russia since MiG!
I love Ye man. dope producer/rapper, and now making music for the Lord & bringing souls to Christ. I wonder if God gonna let him hit a little of "Jesus Walks" one day in Heaven?
The reason the songs only 3 minutes long is because more ads could be put between em
where was this filmed? the landscape is great
Appreciate kanye when you still have him
oh sweet you love kanye too of course you do ! ive just discovered his stuff its amazing right!
Now that’s what I call an intro🔥
I decided to watch this today out of nowhere, and its been a year since release. 93
Ayeeeeeee! This goes(HARD) high towards the sky 🆙 there.
if I don’t hear “that ain’t Christlike” from his dad I’m rioting

edit: that’s it I’m rioting
I remember the day this song came out. I was on the bus listening to music and it was the first day of snow that year and when his dad came on I thought it was a religious ad and then the song came on and I was so hyped up and at my school we have basketball in the morning so I went in and I went off. 3 days later we had tryouts and my school has a big tournament and I carryed my team to a championship
God bless You and Your family!
🙌🏻🔥🕊️💖
1:08 When you are alone and listening rap songs
That intro powerful I didn’t get until I started to ask God for wisdom 👏
I bet it feels good to drive around on your own 4000 acres . God is good.
This song goes hard ... Miss this Kayne :) best goes hard..
prolly every single person that fw this song aint religious
Follow God 
only GOD  and one GOD 
ALLAH 
NO Trinity
Im glad you woke up brother. Praise Yawheh <3
I like the New Kanye, the Good mood Kanye, Scream at the end Kanye, Friends with his dad Kanye!!
How does any song have more views than this. This is purity
Kanye sold his soul to the devil and he said that loudly in front of the audiences in the stage, but he return his soul back and worship God again :)
TOOK ME ABOUT THAT LONG TOO..... To, REALIZE MY DADDY IS MY BEST FRIEND..... see this why I love me some Kanye West..... he is beyond a walking miracle. GOD BLESS HIM AND HIS DAD!!!
Can’t look at this the same after the meme😂
Lecrae: “I’m not a ‘Christian’ artist.”
Kanye: “I just want to make music for God”
What is happening lol..
This song got me closer to my dad , im Trying to flex like Kanye ine day
I was screaming at my dad and he told me it aint christ like ! LOL!!!!
HAha...I still love this.  I'm bipolar too and my dad warped my ass.
If you every realize he never said not one curse word that  impression coming from The Yeezy
"I DONT EVEN LIKE LIKES" - Legendary
If the last 3 albums were like this,  I'd still be a fan but.
Kanye- it's your brother Adam, you know the Harvest Angel. Get ahold of me ..... See messages below. 

Adam
God bless USA 🇺🇸
Y'all!!! 🔥🔥 I am grateful that all the rappers that I grew up with are starting to help turn this ship around. I've been places, but right now today I am about that God shit ya know💚
"It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend" i felt that
2:12 when you're about to sneeze
I really got my school to play this song out loud and made it bass booted
Kanye damn rip this verse apart damn..
He livin on crrative mode
“He asked me how many acres. I told him 4000. He said A BLACK MAN?” Powerful! Keep in mind his father was a black panther back in the day.
This song has some of the best triggers I’ve ever heard! Awesome imagery, and recollection. Gave me that all at once feeling, about three dimensions, my family, my dog, my failure, your family and how you have implemented this aspect into your life and I’m proud of you Kanye sentiment. And may my own recognizance of failures be turned into stronger love and more fluent poetry of expression from within. God Bless.
This is my favorite track from this album
1:01 they looked at the same time and ON BEAT XD
I love how this is essentially the opposite of your typical hip hop video. Once again, Kanye thinking way outside the box.
This video is a bigger flex than any amount of foreign cars or designer clothes could ever be
I can never get tired of this song
I love you KANYE!!!! YOU FEAR GOD.
life with Jesus you feel safe free and sweet go Kanye keep preaching the good gospel because He is a good GOD!
It's hard to find positivity in hip hop nowadays. Thank u Yeezy!
I feel like Kanye isn't afraid of changing himself as a person and as an artist. That is HUGE and I respect that. 🙏🏻
DIS MY MFN ANTHEM THANK YOU YE
Hallelujah wow glory to Jesus Christ amen 🙏 super excited 😆
SHERP - ШЕРП !!!!! From Russia with love))))
Produced by my boy xcel congrats on the awards my boy!! U deserve it!
Rhyming like old Kanye.
Production like old Kanye.
Flexing in a Sherp.

Can't help but love this one.
It reminds me, I gotta call my dad.
Y luego insulta en twitter alv, amén xd
Thank you for everything you are doing. Truly, Thank you!
Fire fighters know you have to fight fire with fire. Kanye's choir is so beautiful, I got to hear them when they performed in Wyoming.
Love the parallel to Otis. This is basically a huge f you to Jay-Z 😂
I LOVE THE NEW KANYE 
NO MORE SAD KANYE
COOL WITH HIS DAD KANYE
GO GET YA BAG KANYE
This comment like my life
Im so proud of Kanye forget the judgement from man i believe God is pleased
This shows there still some old Kanye   Still in him
34k people disliked the video,








That aint christ like
"but nobody will ever tell you when you're being like Christ."
And they be sayin Kanye fell off ....
1:19 is my hometown homeless dudes go-to move on the street corner.
Rap music (whether Christian or not) is not for me.  HOWEVER, listening to this song I have nothing but admiration and respect for Kaney West.  He has been such a blessing to millions of people with his un-apologetic boldness and witnessing for Jesus.  If I start listing all the blessings I want to fall upon him the list will be a mile long.  Can't wait to meet him someday in our Father's House.
Only track worth listening to on that record IMO but good enough to make the whole record worth it. Love the end text too.
"but nobody will ever tell you when you're being like Christ."
What a Johnny Cash moment, love the it
I love that many musicians are showing there love for god recently
kanyes 10 years ahead of time
i will shave my head if anyone listens this for more than 4 times in headphones continuously
Reconciling and forgiving your father is even more Christ like
Kanye my daddy the same way 😭
Thank you Kanye for sparking the flame that led me to reach out to my dad
Man my 1st listen, profound and christlike , namaste.
I said.. AAAAHHHH!
I always think tht my dad was my best friend..coz am equally crazy as he was all the time.!!  Follow God ✌🏼
Kanye west:I Am The rap god

Also Kanye west:I am going to be a president.
The world slept on this song just because it was from a gospel album
They really be the only black people that live in Wyoming
He’s genuinely happy to be with his father. I think he’s on the right to track towards happiness.
Kanye brother, just truly repent and truly trust the Lord
1 year to the day. Thank the Good Lord for Ye creating this. God will even work through sinners.
Next to Dre & Premo Ye has the Best sample game! 💯
kanye west iz da best for prez!
if secondary color goes three, we be deemed unnecessary-unless we go west. dat da best !
Ye driving a armored up tractor sitting on 4000 acres of land that he owns as a black man with his dad that nobody knew he even spoke to.. That's inspirational af
GOD BLESS  KANYE WEST, tank you for this song sir 🙏🙏
"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."Amen
A lot of y’all saying Kanye crazy but when he became more a genius with this god stuff
Thanks ye, for giving me Christian music that slaps.
The devil like to remind you of your past, remind him of his future.
Legend 💯 what’s the instrumental
Explod your mind with this music been a religious or not, just enjoy 😌
Reflection and to be able to hang with your dad in your success and new found faith... Dope 😎
This shit is soooooo hard.
A real revolutionary statement: Jesus Christ is king.
I rapped this song in front of my whole church audience, thank you Ye
FALSE PROFIT!!! He doesn’t even read the scripture when he performs in church... For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.! Matthew 24:5
One bit looks a bit like 'me and my dad driving JCB' 😊😂👍👍👍
Kanye’s albums always drop when i’m at a shitty point in my life and they make life a little bit better
I was looking at the gram' and I dont even like likes
What is the first track (in the beginning)
plz hepl🥺
keep fighting the devil. we love u!
1:08 hosting a concert to my neighbours
I'm here after he gifted 2 chains the sherp Atv
My Yeezys just upgraded to Jesus sandals because of this song.
Man's driving them gta tank tings 😂
Head these warnings of the end of this amazing story.  This is truth, lets not let it come back ever ever again.  <3 EVERYONE
This 🔥 too hot for the devil.
Had to listen to this to cleanse my ears from WLR
At the end when it says “It took me 42 years to realise that my dad was my best friend” CHRIST LIKE 🙌🏽
LOVE JESUS, LOVE GOD
Damn Ye!  I wish this bop was 3x as long!  That beat....👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Kanye I am crying. Thank you. This is so powerful
no doubt God is so Good,Amen!Alleluyah!🙏🏼❤️👌🏼😌the Lord always reaches put,yes Powerful i agree👌🏼😌❤️Thankyou Jesus you always speak on time in our lives🙏🏼
Those 32k dislikes ain't Christ-like.
This so lit 🔥
Everyone wanna talk shit on Ye but he keeps it real af, Im glad he got with his pops again, some real influential shit, the sample is hard af also that ending slide hit hard, his dad couldnt imagine anyone owning 4k acres of land
God bless🙏👼
I'll go fishing with your dad.
307 represent!
Kanye is on a whole nother level. Flexin on the devil.
That’s Beautiful! 
Father & Sun
feels good to see Ye smiling
Yo this is crazy. Yo he flipped on this. Im going into 2021 on this.
I think it's so dope that Kanye included his dad in this video. This is a father/son experience shared with the world. There should be more of this.
This dude Kanye West really just took his cars out of his GTA V garage...
Congratulations 👏 on your billboard win, 4 wins
At the end when he screamed he looked a lot like North
I told god i be back in a second damn its so so hard not to act reckless... la la laaaa wait till i get my money right! He done got his money right!
god never put you up to more than you could take.  satan was limited against job.  because satan could never steal god from jesus and job
I feel like he found himself , like he’s truely happy.
one day I will collab with Kayne. The goat.
This is some dope music Kanye! Praise god and Jesus! The good & the light! 🙏🏼
me being a muslim watching this video like: 👁️👄👁️
Can't believe this a year old already
Kanye: "It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend"

My feelings: *oof*
This is soo sweet!  Love be showed when it was in the real 907!! For real though! That shit would be lit!
God Bless you Kanye West
God bopping his head in heaven to this🙏🏽😤
'my girl ain't no hobbit!'
You know he is a changed man because he’s smiling all the time
It’s the size of his backyard for me ...🤯🤦🏾‍♂️
I was screaming at the referee just like mike...
Is that mike tyson or mike jordan?
Kanye out here exorcising demons!
In Jesus Name for He alone is the King of kings& Lord of lords!
I wanna chill with Jesus in Heaven and listen to this
Jesus is coming soon turn from sin and trust in him
Your music... I am thankful for you.. God Bless you Kanye West and your family <3
i woke up this mornin said my prayers
And Beyonce’s black is king album is somehow supposed to compare on some level against this album..

delusion is 1 hell of a drug!!

😂
It’s great that he’s finally friends with his dad, especially since his mom died
You can walk in the footprints and then make your own too
Kanye is misunderstood. He's a genius and a innovator. We need more people like him!
When you first listen to the the song and don't the lyrics it goes like:  pike sike i don't know if i i'll get nike signed but it ain't chris like😂😂😂
Why he got the car from gta
Didn’t curse once, now that’s Christ like.
God bless you
Belive in Jesus, follow him and be saved 🙏❤️
Way Kanye's father closed door, let J know he ain't extorting anyone nka
Man this beat is harder than a mug....I put it up there with the very best!!! Plus the words of Christ like on fire.
Kanye always brings different/new things to music. This man is doing donuts with a square monster truck beside llamas in snowy Wyoming. This is awesome
This is one of the BEST Songs Ever Recorded. NO CAP!
Love you Kanye this video is amazing! Great message.
this song is too short in length
YES!  Drive the atheists out of Hip-Hop.

Hip-Hop > hip pop
Kanye made me call my dad afther 19 years
I'll also put what his father said in the beginning in my own words:

The meaning of following god is like repeating the same words as him, and knowing that he exists. Following his presence, knowing he's out there somewhere, and following the acts of Christianity to make sure you are what god created.
That beat SLAPS 🔥
The classic Kanye moves with his back to the camera I missed that
The Word 🔥🙏🏼
"A black man?" That's a powerful thing. People of his dad's age seeing not only a black man but his son owning so much land must be a lot to take in. So much pride.
Kanye West is one of the most brilliant musicians I ever had the opportunity to hear. As well as artist. Kanye West is from Chicago, Im from Minneapolis.
Kanye come perform at our spring semester concert!
so good & he's so humble..
Too bad there are so many people out there without a father. Democrats wont have their way much longer.
Me: This song lit as hell

Kanye: *imma stop you right there*
The real winner of 2020 BET Best Gospel/Inspirational Award.
amazing he has found God, this is very good news for black youth
as a muslim, I can confirm this album slaps hard
as a black man who's trying to make it and has a dad who is still alive and despite working really hard is still really broke, that last frame with the words was powerful
Kanye and his dad is the most wholesome thing of 2019
This song is amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
"But nobody tell you when you like Christ" He ain't lying
i love kanye's dances its my hypeness on god
LAkkkkkkkeeerrrssssss
💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳💪💪💪🙏
Other rappers: Bunch of money, gold, cars
Kanye: Driving in tractor with dad
They have the same smile 😇
As long as Kanye keeps singing about the light and God truly the light will have his back
1:08 is the best part of the video tbh, I missed Kanye 😢
Best rapper ever his beliefs are something so great you're a great man
That massive off-road thing is probably one of the biggest flex of 2019
As a Christian I’m waiting for all the Sunday school teachers to find Yeezus
LOVE YOU KANYE YOU GON CHANGE THE WORLD, HERE CHANGING WITH YOU!!!
kanye is the new tesla in a world full of evil and misunderstandings let's not let kanye die or end up hospitalized because people think he is crazy just because he is ahead of the rest of the world
I have been a huge fan of Kanye since day one and the more he does the more I love him. Love you Ye! You get better with time and I hope you never stop.
This is like Otis but Kanye is older and really different
“it took me 42 years to realize my dad was my best friend”
He sold his soul to the devil
✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿🤎blm
While the rest of the world is listening to WAP, I’m here listening to Kanye’s amazing music.
*Kanye flexing with his dad is the best thing i've seen this week*
stretch my hands to you
This shit is fire 🔥
هلليلويا ❤️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️
this sounds like something for a w2k12 song on the menu. fucking bomb
People really out here acting like it’s impossible for this man to change. Do y’all forget that he’s human too?
Best intro 2019
Love the rig!
1:24 2 chainz rode one of those things.
“man”
the vibe of this song is kinda like the Christian counterpart to Ye’s and Jay-Z’s Otis
2020 gang this song so powerful
Song dope, but the video tho. Kanye can't rap in his videos anymore?
1:53 kanye doing the diamond casino heist
Most rappers out here dissin each other while Kanye The Genius be dissin the devil
The only reason why this has a too many dislikes is because it’s not long enough.
Love you Kanye 💓💓💓👍😘🤗 "You r my motivation"!!!💓💓💓👍💓😘🤗🤗
we are all sinners destined for hell. “For God so love the  world he gave his  only begotten son that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life” (john 3:16) Accept Jesus as your Lord and savior today!
You gotta take life one step at a time, no matter how shitty it can be
1 Now these [are] the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do [them] in the land whither ye go to possess it:
2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it]; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:
5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:
7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,
11 And houses full of all good [things], which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
12 [Then] beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which [are] round about you;
15 (For the LORD thy God [is] a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted [him] in Massah.
17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
18 And thou shalt do [that which is] right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,
19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. (Deuteronomy 6:1, KJV)
I’m so happy he’s establishing a relationship with his dad again. RIP Donda West🙏💙

Is that his Dad ?
Weird. This is the first time I've ever seen Ye's dad. I kinda thought we was dead. It's nice to see Ye and Papa Ye together though.
I use to hear this at the barber shop and I loved this song
This is straight up blasphemy. I can't even feel the Holy Spirit on this one. Wake up all you who are in slumber!
First person to tell me the correct name and where to buy kanye's lightgrey bodywarmer gets a reward

The odds of you seeing this comment, is 0.000001%. I never saw this coming. Not you finding god, not you making Christian music.  But, hey, real proud of you. You have real talent, and I'm glad you're using this talent for this message.
Finally I can blast Kanye in the car without my parents complaining about the "cursing" and telling me to turn it off 😁
🔥
Follow your spirit not another human being
I am a non-believer for more than four years now but this type of music always gives me the chills. Respect from Turkey, hope you all find peace no matter what you believe in!
This why Kanye will always be one of the best to do it
He went from doing donuts with Jay-z in a benz with the top off on Otis, to doing donuts with his dad in a Jesus Tank on Follow God.. Father and Son goals..
Help me Lord. I don't wanna make me mom sad anymore. Give me the strength to quit pills please God
So this is what he was listening to on that plane
Kanyes outfit in this video was my halloween costume this year
This monologue I slept on it 😢😢
I honestly love Kanye's hand movements in this video

"...Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved..." - Acts 16:31

“He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.” - John 3:18 Kjv
ART!
Kanye is a lot of things. And one of those things is an artist. Undeniably talented
Kanye “low key” made a new version of “OTIS”.........the short gospel version
please somebody make a 10 min bundle of this
The Beat goes Hard AF for a Gospel song🙏🏾🙏🏾

Idk if y'all can see the resemble from otis
when you see a rat come out of nowhere 2:14
I’m proud Kanye is following what he believes in.
Don't worry these ''so called Christians'' judging your life saying how can he be saved making those mistakes in his life - everyone makes mistakes, that's why Jesus came into to the world - "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance". Take it easy on yourself guys, it's not such a stressful thing to be saved 🙌
I'm praying for you Kanye! Jesus Loves you ! This is fire!
what if kanye's scream represented his demons getting exorcised
Genius as usual.
Remember Kanye when he thought smiling was uncool. 
It’s amazing how much he smiles now.
music has been ran by ol s@tan himself for way too long. props to Kanye for trying to take it back
All during Christ’s life on earth, Christ demonstrated His love through humility. If anyone addressed Him as “Good Master”, he replied, “None is good, save one, that is, God: (Luke 18:19).” When  Jesus worked miracles, He often forbade those present to speak of them. Observe Him as He stopped to wash and wipe the feet of His disciples. Through His love, by depths did He descend to teach the profound lessons of humility!

Since pride was the gateway through which man chose to pass on his tragic journey (from supernatural life to a state of sin), it was only natural that the second Adam should lead fallen man back to supernatural life through the gateway of humility. He told them, “...learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, humble in heart (Matthew 11:29).” The virtue of humility drives pride from us.

~David E. Taylor~
I’m struggling with my relationship with Jesus, can somebody give me some proof that he’s really there? I pray day after day. I pray that I want to follow in his footsteps. But my reverend Jesse Lee Peterson tells me you become what you hate. I hate the devil. Will I become the devil? Some days I feel like I hate god. He killed my dog and calls me to watch people suffer when I don’t want to. What do I do?
معرف ليه مشتركه بقناته 🌚💔
He's finally smiling, Jesus saved him!
Why does he scream at the end?
Kayne 2020!!! FOLLOW GOD
Athiest in the name of god.
they killed kenny :(
One thing that Kanye has always done is be himself. He's not afraid of what other people think of him.
when everyone realize that 786K people like this I mean 786
This Man Is Crazy 🥵
Coronavirus messed everything up.
It messed people up. It messed life up. 
God is here to cure everything. Hopefully.

Amen.. Follow God 🙏❤️❤️❤️
Love seeing Kanye West with his dad, Ray West.  Also, like the positive message of faith and family in this song and video.

This song turned my yeezys into Jesus sandals

Thanks for this many likes.
God bless!
I don’t understand why people always wanna clarify they’re “not religious” when saying they like the song or the songs fire.  You really don’t have to be religious to enjoy this piece of art
The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
The amount of dislikes makes me sad 🙁 wow
Xd its the Rune Zhaba from gta, aka the sherp at 1:24
Kanye being embarrassed in front of his dad is the best thing I've seen in a while.

We all make fun of him, but deep down we love him
Even though the beat of this song is nice, still don’t compare to Gods love
Kanye man hate him or love him you gotta admit it’s one hell of a journey he’s been through.
GOD bless you..i'll pray for you..JESUS IS THE KING THE ONLY SAVIOR
Kanye is back on track if you ask me. Positive vibes.
Beautiful people! Anyone that knows me, knows that I moved to the middle of nowhere Japan to focus, and to create groundbreaking music! At 26, I almost let fear stop me from starting, but I took action. I am open to blending all genres into hip-hop. In this specific song, we blend it with some Vince Guaraldi Jazz! It is a single from our EP called 🌺"Scenery"🌺, which just came out! A chill, super dope, summer - fall, international project... recorded in both Japan🇯🇵, and America 🇺🇸! I hope that you all enjoy this, and the EP (Which is on my page). 
This track is called "Schroeder and Lucy", People say that it has a ATCQ, common, Tyler the creator, Mac Miller vibe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrKu99BK4Y4
God bless 🙌
Kanye west 2004: Jesus walks

Hey im Hope. Was raised by a single mother. Relatives had to play a huge role in me growing up since my mom wasn't working. 
However in recent years God has showered me amd my mom with tons of blessings ww both just bought cars. 
In my room after work im used to making beats on my pc l, songwrite and sometimes record some stuff and keep it in my pc. 
However i just did a song called God's Work in my room which is about acknowledging God's grace in my life and i feel this is worth people's attention. I decided to post it and im hoping you can watch it  and dedicate it to God for whatever he has ever done in your life. 
Please search HopEezy God's Work and maybe comment or subscribe or like or go there through the video link   https://youtu.be/U8Il_W-99eA thank you

7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. (Hosea 6:5, KJV)

When Kanye went “Ahhhh..”

I felt that
The Lord God is Not mocked. Woe woe woe unto the inhabitants of the Earth. A real angel showed up not looking like a man. Please click on the picture in the thumbnail and watch the video of Bible prophecy revealed from The Book of Revelations real Fallen Angel World War 3 come see

The thing about this is it’s actually real fire lol.
You wanna follow god ,devorce a Kardashian
Those dislikeres don't follow god
JESUS IS COMING SO SO SOON Y’ALL! Repent and trust in Jesus alone! Lemme know how I can pray for you :)

God has made the world good and perfect, He made people in His own image for community and fellowship- but we as humans have rebelled against God by sinning. ALL of us have sinned. Whether it’s lying, gossip, stealing, using His name in vain, looking at someone with lust, hating someone etc. ALL of us have fallen short of God’s perfect standard and law. And just like on earth there’s punishment for breaking the law, so there is punishment for breaking God’s law: death and eternal separation in hell. But here’s the good news: out of God’s deep and unconditional love for us, He sent His one and only Son to live the life we should’ve. Jesus is 100% man and 100% God (yes, at the same time), He has never committed any sin (even tho He was tempted to), and He just loves you ever so much. And because of these traits, He is the only one able and worthy to take on our punishment. Jesus paid the price IN FULL for our past, present and future sins, just so that you don’t have to. And then 3 days later, Jesus rose from the dead, proving that His sacrifice was accepted in God’s eyes. Now all you have to do, is trust in Jesus alone for your salvation and repent (turn away from your sins). And remember, we are not saved by our works or deeds, we’re saved by grace through faith.

God is so good! He has pulled me out of the darkest place, and sharing the Gospel is just in the hopes that He can do it to someone else too. It’s like finding the cure for a currently incurable disease and not telling anyone, what kind of a person does that?
God is amazing!!!!
Eminem had beef with the rap devil

Kanye had beef with the devil
🔥

Over a thousand people were led to Christ at one of Kanye's Sunday Services, however some people still doubting... Check it TRUST GOD and watch God keep his promise and do even greater things through every person willing to step up to the calling. Praise GOD ❤

What DOES IT MEAN 0:00
2:14
👍🔥🔥🔥
I like how kanye went from singing 'I love it' to being a full blown Christian rapper.
everybody hates him because he happy and truly found him self with god
HOW TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IN HEAVEN WHEN YOUR BODY DIES AND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD WHO LOVES YOU: believe in the Son of God: 
~John 3:16 (NIV) "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
WHAT EXACTLY DOES BELIEVING IN GOD'S SON MEAN?: accept God's testimony about his Son:
 ~1 John 5:10: "Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son." 
 WHAT IS GOD'S TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS SON? here it is: 
~1 John 5:11-13 "And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."


DO I HAVE TO DO ANY WORKS? no! you are saved freely! you will go to heaven when you die now! Reference verses:


~John 6:26-29 "Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.” Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”"

~Ephesians 2:8-9: " For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—  not by works, so that no one can boast."
~Romans 4:2-8: " If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
“Blessed are those
    whose transgressions are forgiven,
    whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the one
    whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”"

~Romans 3:20-31: "Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.  Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law."

Am I saved forever now? no need to worry? yep! you are sealed with the Holy Spirit!

~Ephesians 1:13-14: "And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory."


I still find myself sinning- why?
 ~Romans 7:14-24: "We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin."
I’m praying for you Kanye. My one little prayer may not do much, but the Lord told us that if we gather in his name it shall be and I know there’s plenty more than me. Don’t give up and don’t give in. No matter what they try to do to you or threaten you with, even if it’s the worse GODS GOT YOU BROTHER! ❤️ You’ve got an army behind you. I know you’re not crazy. Like Chapelle said, maybe the environment you’re in is a little sick. We love you, Kanye. 
Thank you for speaking about the wrongs in the industry, no matter how many times they try to silence you we’ll always listen! Thank you for speaking out about God too and giving other celebrities a place of worship in a town that rejects worship of Christ altogether. Prayers & love, always.

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like type write
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"

I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like excite bike (stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"

But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three a piece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (stretch my hands to You)

I'm just tryna find, I've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my dad (stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Aah"
People say they miss the Old Kayne but this is the most 'Old Kayne' New Kayne has ever sounded if you ask me. This is Kayne going back to his roots.

"A fool despises his father’s discipline,

but a person who accepts correction is sensible...
A wise son brings joy to his father..."

Proverbs 15:5, 20

Thanksgiving keeps you in the will of God and IF you're out of His will thanksgiving supernaturally transports you in the will!! The moment Jonah said I’m gonna praise you God put him back in the will!! If you start giving God praise in whatever situation your in He will spit you up out of that situation!! ~David E. Taylor~

"But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. " (Jonah 2:9-10 KJV)

In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. (1 Thessalonians 5:18 KJV)

FACE~TO~FACE with JESUS... 

As I go into prayer and seek my King -Jesus, the fellowship is so awesome and intense, that when I come out of it, I’ve realized it’s been at least 10 hours, sometimes more, of Him pouring His love over me and then me pouring my Love on Him... So intense is it, that it knocks me out to sleep after a whole day’s prayer of INTIMACY... I have to get a good days rest just to wake up and Love Him again... For I love Him “with all my STRENGTH” and every bit of it is used just to wake up again to Love Him... I arise morning by morning to start this process all over again just to Love Him and spend time with Him all day... THIS IS LIFE TO ME...!!! And it is the secret behind this great ministry given to me.. IT’S THE FELLOWSHIP!” 

~David E. Taylor~
This man literally does whatever he wants. I can respect that. Oh and that last quote was hella powerful

kanye out here flexing his tank and his 4000 acres
Damn. The simpleness of this is just perfect. Ye really knows how to send a quick message.
is it weird that everyone you see post something its all ways like 1 year or 7 months.         ? weird
This song goes hard
I don’t believe in any god and I don’t particularly like kanye but this track is dope
Masterpiece
"This is like a movie but it's very life like"
hell may be hot, but i guide that fire.  it's my body on fire.  and my soul with my mind. united on gods chains of love.   i can take it all.  i will.  beat the hell out of me god, i still don't hold it against you.  because god will never beat you, nor can he remove hell, but you can use gods light to channel that hell out of you.  that light comes from the fire itself, when you channel all that temptation through a magnet of lightning, sparking through, burning away.  you contain that furnace, and you can't be burnt unless you give satan the very flammable materials to through you with his flame.  refuse yourself the very temptation, and satans fuse will go against him.  you will create beautiful light when you make the holy water glow.  that's where it comes from.  the rest is co2.  that's how chemistry works, god.  god is behind it all.  it is very meta my friend.
Man this beat is niceee
Christ world is so good at minimum. It's the syringe ✝ Only dope to the wise ✝ Keep leaning out of your own understanding and gripping on not money, but GOD ✝ Later, Happy Universe ✝
This is the third time Kanye uses this sample?
The sad part is the world is not ready for the message he’s sending. People do NOT understand the importance of mental health !!  Kanye is perfect example of true growth and success and what the power of one can accomplish!

..there is a book by Tony Tymstra titled: What is possible? What is impossible? and What is probable ? Proof that God exists. ...here is a chapter you might find interesting ...the book is on amazon

                                         THE THEORY OF ONE

                                    Life in the Universe is unique



The Theory of One suggests that everything in the Universe is

an essential substructure used to create and support life here on		

this planet. Every single thing in the Universe is connected, and

everything in it is needed or was needed to produce this unique

place we called Earth. All the stars, all the galaxies, all the

planets, everything in the Universe helped produced this single

outcome. The Earth and the Universe are one place.

The Theory of One examines three principal elements for life

in the Universe to be unique.

1. Requirements.

2. Essential Conditions.

3. Necessary Connections and Cosmic Relationships.

A simple example of a Requirement for life is the need for

"sunlight." The Sun, which is a star, produces a broad spectrum

of energy in the form of charged particles and electromagnetic

radiation. Sunlight is only a small part of that spectrum. Plants

use sunlight directly by turning carbon dioxide into sugars in a

process called photosynthesis.



But deep in the ocean, there are some autotrophs, a type of

bacteria that do not need direct sunlight. They use the energy

from the Earth's hot core. These bacteria use chemicals like

methane and hydrogen sulfide emitted from hydrothermal

vents on the ocean's floor to make their food. They need the

Sun's energy indirectly; without this sunlight, the Earth would

not have enough of its own heat to sustain them.

The second principle element is the Essential Conditions, and

as such, this "required sunlight" needs a unique sun. This sun

will need to be the ideal candidate. We do not want a sun that

produces intense bursts of deadly gamma rays or x-rays for

example.

The third element is the Necessary Connections and Cosmic

Relationships that exist among all objects, both directly and

indirectly. Continuing to follow through with this sunlight

example, it would mean that this ideal sun and its delicate

attributes have established a unique relationship with this

planet. The Earth's magnetic field interacts with this "sunlight,"

providing a protective shield. This magnetic field is dependent

on the structure of the planet's molten core. And as such, the

Sun has a complicated relationship with Earth. It generates our

weather patterns, produces the albedo effect, and even helps to

develop vitamin D in the human body. The Sun's

electromagnetic radiation plays a role in a countless number of

other natural events here on Earth.



The emerging consequences from examining these three key

elements suggest that the "Requirements" for life are extremely

precise and that the "Conditions" are seemingly endless. More

importantly, these "Connections and Relationships" are

extraordinarily demanding and far-reaching. The Theory of One

goes on to say that these three principles produce an expanding

relationship and profound connective dependence, which

ultimately includes everything in the Universe. The Earth and

the Universe are indeed one place.

What are some of the logistical requirements for life to emerge

on Earth? Here on this planet, we have acquired the proper

blend of chemical elements needed to develop life. This correct

chemical balance was only possible because of this planet's

remarkable location in the Milky Way Galaxy. This planet's

position is critical because if the Earth formed closer to the

center of the Milky Way, then we would have acquired too

many of the lighter elements, and the existence of life would

have become highly unlikely. If, on the other hand, this planet

was formed farther out in the galaxy, we would then have too

many of the heavier elements and the possibility of life evolving

and flourishing would also be highly unlikely. We can continue

to expand on these aspects and requirements. For example, we

also need the Moon, but not just any moon. We need this Moon

and its exact properties.



The Moon stabilizes the Earth's motion producing a needed

steady and reliable weather system. The Moon also affects

Earth's plate tectonics, which in turn plays a role in our carbon

cycle. The Moon also produces the tides, which ultimately

helped develop life. Our Sun is 93,000,000 miles away (150

million kilometers), for life to exist on this planet we depend on

this Sun. It is an exceptional Sun; it is one which is not too hot

and not too cold. This Sun needed to be in a stable state and in

the proper stage of development long enough for life to develop

on Earth. Not only do we need this Sun to be the right type and

size of star, but we also need it to be in the correct position and

distance. Now, if the Sun were just a fraction of a distance

closer, then Earth's water would have eventually evaporated

into space. And yet, on the other hand, if it were a fraction of

the distance further away we would have become a cold dead

planet of ice.

This Sun has its' own vast complex requirements and "far off"

external influences. Those cosmic interactions ultimately

complement and support our existence. And those "far off"

external influences and interactions demand their own

requirements. Furthermore, we need a solar system with

massive planets like Jupiter and Saturn. These planets protect

us. They shield this planet from incoming asteroid disasters and

comet impacts—these giant planets "sweep clean" our solar

system.



We needed and still need their size and gravitational strength

to prevail, even though these planets are millions upon millions

of miles away. But it doesn't end there. Just these two planets

alone have many of their own cosmic prerequisites. They have a

vast number of critical conditions and precise requirements,

which are also complicated and far-reaching. All these

conditions and requirements are time-sensitive; they all need to

be created within a similar time period. That requirement alone

is an incredible plight.

We can continue to expand the idea behind the Theory of One.

The Milky Way Galaxy, which we are located in, has its own

vast complex requirements and correspondence. As such, it

interacts with other galaxies, which in turn have their own

interactions and conditions. These direct and indirect

relationships support our existence and extend the connection

to everything in the Universe. It is truly remarkable. This

network does not stop or fade away with distance.

In conclusion, The Theory of One suggests that everything in

the Universe is connected and is required to support life here on

this planet. Is it possible for life to exist elsewhere in the

Universe? I can imagine it, but the necessary conditions to reoccur somewhere else would be astronomically rare, with an

outrageously small probability. We are probably unique in this Universe.



Author's note:



The possibility that life on Earth might indeed be unique

should not be considered as a bad thing or desolate idea. It would mean this planet

is extremely precious. In much the same way, you are also truly

unique. There is only "one of you," and there will never be

another "one of you" in the future, as there was never

"another one of you" in the past. That might sound confusing at

first, but it is just a way of saying you are as unique as the Universe itself.
It's that Kanye!!!!

Kanye is just my favorite
Kanye West you have no idea how many lives you can touch like this
If you purchase that much land how do you ensure people not going on it ? It'd be hard to know when someone is on it or not .
I think the real breaking point in your life is, when you start walking in front. When you conciously make your steps towards your dreams, your visions or whatever you'd like to achieve.
Trust in Jesus he died for your sins, believe the gospel. Repent!!! If you do sin confess your sins, ask him to help you overcome your sins he will. Obey Jesus, live by his teachings, be led by the Holy Spirit. The Lord is coming soon you must live by his teachings. The love of God is beyond our understanding...,,
Beautiful comment
“This was selfless of Ye to show us his Dad’s experience with him. “A Black Man?”  Very Powerful Statement. He never thought possible but for his sons to show him that, it most likely blew his mind.
Kanye is blessed and highly favoured. God is good.
My comment got deleted because i said something like Kanye doesn't have to impress y'all Pretty wierd😕😕
If my Spirit rejoices over your salvation then how much more does God & His angels rejoice over you my bro, Kanye 🥳👏 We so need more Christians like you - BOLD, FEARLESSLY TRUE TO YOUR TRUTH, IT’S ALL OR NOTHING, A THOUGHT LEADER , HONORING GOD GIVEN GIFT TO BLESS GOD & OTHERS 🎼 🎵 👍What a legend & ETERNAL legacy you will leave for your family/children and their children 🌟💕 You & your family are in my prayer 🙏🏻 🕊
JAY-Z is God of the earth in the book of Revelation. I know this because I have the name “Jesus” on my thigh. Apocalypse/Revelation 19:16 says on His robe and thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS. Donald Trump is a beast in Apocalypse

Baraku את Yahuah, ha’me’verach l’olam vaed, asher natan lanu את ha’malchuth’ka adamah, go’el B’Mashiach.

Blessed are you את Yahuah, forever and ever, for giving us את your Kingdom on earth, redeemed in Messiah.
Spread it.   Like butter with a rhythm.   One of Gods greatest disciples.   Thank you, Kanye.

Thank you, Jesus.
You are beautiful, Kanye.
Fellows let's ftpu
Kanye spreading Jesus's message like one of his students
The greatest thing happening in the world right now.

Jesus himself made a covenant promise once you read this book He will appear to you in a dream. Book; Face to face appearances by Jesus. 

Millions have experienced a visitation from Jesus.

"The Lord appeared to Apostol David 
E,Taylor in a dream and told him to write a book. He said: "I want you to write a book called "Face to Face Appearances" and show by Scripture from my Word how I want to come to everyone. When you write this book, I will appear to everyone who reads it. I will also appear to whole cities in America and before whole nations around the world", Face to Face is a global message that has been translated into multiple languages and is infiltrating the world!"

In Kenya enjoying this song like crazy
This the truck he gifted to Chris brown!
💗Siii
The only problem with this song is it isn't long enough
I can listen to this all day
🙏👏🙏
to follow god is to follow love
He is not crazy. Not perfect; Only Christ is PERFECT
1 Year ago Today.
I was looking at the gram and I don’t even like likes.
I don't think he knows that hes talking about ENDGAME vs what real people are going thought with no money and no good life. 
He's at the top of the mountain and trying, but this has never worked out.
Kanye got to the top not being GOOD, they were everything but clean good.
And he made it and now he's this...
new moses hehehehehehehehehehehehe
Hollywood this is your official diss track
coolest snow vehicle commercial ever
He just gave society a breath of fresh air.  Yes, being true and honest is still cool.
Awesome video! Love it!
Kanye one of the 🐐
where did they film this??
Hope you go fishing with your father nothing better in Life
This must be one of the most random music videos I’ve ever seen. I like it
👑✊🏾☂️🔋
“The problem is,

 why are the leaders of today not looking for MORE? WHY are these guys settling for less than what we are called to be? We are supposed to MANIFEST the same POWERS that the fathers of old did!!! We are suppose to do greater!! The New Testament is founded upon GREATER promises!” ~David E. Taylor~
Y’all ready for him to be president tomorrow 💪🏼
Lama & Donkey on point
No drugs, alcohol, twerking. Amazing.
I thank ''god'' for kanye. Therefore, I thank kanye for kanye.

God is good all the time.
[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"
Mr Kanye West is bringing more than just himself and his father together.

Rappers: abusing, insulting other Rappers 
Kanye: *Smoothly drives with dad*

(support this new comedian #ShubhSethi)
Why is this song suddenly towards the good after all his bad deeds?
#followGod
jesus is KING
If you're Christian people will say you're crazy but when God come for us all the Christian will be safe with God and the other ones will suffer in hell
Other rappers: Girls ,Drugs, guns
Kanye: Father, tank
This song is really neat
This is cracked no cap
We blasting this when Kanye wins?
The one person that's against all humanity is the other format unlike humans...
When people asked for the "old kanye" they don't realize that Jesus Walks kanye has made a full circle. This is the "old kanye"

I am religious and this song slaps.

After a long day of work, Kanye West goes to his Kanye Nest to take his Kanye Rest. He wakes up feeling his Kanye Best. Then he’ll get Kanye Dressed on his Kanye Vest to go on a Kanye Quest. He goes to church and becomes Kanye Blessed, then to a hotel room to be a Kanye Guest. Then to school to take his Kanye Test. He forgot to brush his teeth. Did he run out of Kanye Crest? His neighbor stole it, what a Kanye Pest.
Get OUT!!!!!

Kanye and his dad whipping in the Jesusmobile
🕎
Garagashyan rules)))
Can’t decide if God is a friend or foe
Went to heaven once
stayed five minutes and was like
“Let’s go”

Told God we ain’t friends 
he has never done shit for me 
He said I didn’t have to believe in him 
But he would never leave 

One day I’m like okay 
imma believe 🙄
And damn what hasn’t He helped me achieve?

It’s crazy, I think God’s my friend and we never even met
I say I’m not worth it but I hope He don’t forget 

About me and all the promises I made
I think next time I go to heaven
I’ll probably stay
Me encanta
So refreshing to see the promotion of a moral life in hip hop
0:23 Worst advice EVER
Chitown
sherps are cool
I think it's so important to show the restoration of the Father/Son relationship because that's what Christianity really is.
❤️❤️❤️The Beautiful Wife💓💓

The head of Jesus is God the Father, the head of men is Jesus Christ, the head of woman is men. 
When Jesus Christ is the head of the husband his wife shall reverence him and her husband shall praise and honor her ❤💃... 
It is written.
.
She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and deliver-eth girdles onto the merchants.
25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellent them all.
30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
31 Give her of the fruits of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. 
~Proverbs 31:24 By Kings with LOVE~

* You are honored and loved ❤️❤️❤️, created by the Most High LOVE. You are loved by Jesus enough to die for. Gift is the Holy Spirit. Intimacy, power, strength, joy may flourish. Seek He who is true love, that you may become Humble LOVE.

This song is fire, can't stop replaying.
wild horses
Junk!
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three a piece
Bro got the Zhaba
oh dang, a kanye music video. last one he had was i love it lol
Thank you Jah
jesus walk pal
I know this life is stressful. Jesus died to save us from this world. God bless the chat! Reply if you’re hurting. I’m here for you 🙏🏻
I am an old white lady, but I am loving this song.  I gave up listening to 50 cent when my baby girl was born and changed for her I went from my fav song "Many Men" to Christian music, which I love also, but my heart is always going to be in rap.  I am so glad to be able to listen to your music Kanye and not feel like I am ashamed because of the words and message.  I love you and your message about God.  My babies father wanted me to abort her also and I am so glad I loved him too much to do it, now I have the most beautiful, powerful brown 15 year old.  She has some issues to deal with because her father has chosen not to be in her life but I love her enough for both of us I guess.  Thank you for speaking out about abortions because they are our future.  I love you!!!! Most importantly God loves you, and because you love God so much it makes me thankful for you being on Earth.
Many people will pretend they loved Kanye🐐 when he’s dead!

Let’s appreciate him while he’s with us❤️
If you can read this, no matter what you’re going through, Jesus is watching over you and he loves you ❤️
Hearing this one makes me laugh when when people say Mr West can't rap.
YE, We love you, along with the Lord!!!!!!!!
I love you Ye, you are gonna get through this❤️
This is the song I wanna hear when I enter heaven lol
kenny from south park went hard on this one
I just heard what you told about vaccines and it bursted my heart out of love
I'm catholic and I thank God Kanye found the strength to spread the word no matter how many haters he's got.
Kanye kilt that shit when he was doing those hand movements 😂🔥
Bro when this first dropped ....the hype around this freakin album lol....that was a once in a lifetime moment of curiosity we don’t realize we were blessed to witness 😂
Yess, the words of his dad in the beginning... very powerful. We have to walk in the foot steps of Jesus that same way. 
I'm really prayin that Kanye stays on His walk with the Lord and this world doesn't try to pull him back. I wanna see him walk for Christ and make a big impact
Legendary career 🙌🏾
i rly love the part at 1:44 its almost like "yeah my beat goin hard" then he looks at his dad an he aint vibin and he doubts himself. SO FUCKIN RELATABLE
kanye west is definitely in the top 5
Pray for Kanye the industry hates that he's trying to break free from their mind control no cap. There is good and evil in this world that inspires and echoes beyond what you could imagine the Christian worldview is the best explanation of that, word to Jordan Peterson. Ye knows he used to be a devote Luciferian.
This song and that SHERP fire though 🔥 lol
Kanye is a frekin artiest! damn son, soul!
Screw the 4000 acres, I want those trucks!!!
This makes a person feel like they need to put in effort to their passion and grind to become amazing at whatever it is you want to do. Just like Kanye did...
it's good when the father is a friend.

and I'm an ordinary guy. no better than others, and worse than many
Youtube keeps the real views in the dark like the devil
Preach!! Tell me what ya life like!!
I know this whole song
Life goal: Make my own music and vibe out to it like 1:08
this song bumps !
Thank you JESUS for what you’re doing in Kanye’s life!
I don’t wtf is going on in my life. I pray I make it out
This ... sounds to me like College Dropout? After all these years? Kanye did a full circle ?!
still "gay fish" my favorite kanye track
Interesting to see Replika sending me songs i actually listen to for a change.
This song slapped so hard, I turned the other cheek.
thank you kanye. I think I know what I need to do now
Bless the Lord. Amen.
This is giving me Daytona vibes
Thank you Kanye, we need more like you. And get away from the Kardashians
Really well done song and message , much appreciated
If he featured Jay -Z they would been a H.A.M song
Wow, this is actually a good Kayne West song
LOVE FROM OSINATA IN MEMPHIS TN HOMIE!!!!

This is my shield when i go to the bathroom at 3 am

My real well wisher, friend is my Mom❤️ she loves me❤️
I love doing the scream at the end...it freaks everybody out..lol
I have NEVER been into rap. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this song!

We'll never know what happened behind the screen you watch, maybe it just self drama ?
Yes yes, Ty for doing what your doing God bless you brother.
I been doing Christian hip hop since 2000 and man this is dope!
Kanye did a song with Lil Pump. Then he turned to God.
It actually sounds like runnin from creed 2
This is amazing
Kanye es un genio, ojalá tuviera a mi padre. Increíble canción
Lambo?! All I need is that tank.
Thank you Kanye, very halal!
Genius!
I lost my father so this song is very relatable
Kanye l love you..l know we ALL have fell short🙏🏾💙💯👁️BUT I CAN FEEL YOUR PAIN. & YOUR MUSIC..💯💯💯
Kanye keep it real and going brother. We are praying for you and your family here in little Odessa Texas. Gods works.
Ive had an idea to do a parody of the music video with lawnmowers instead of tanks😂
Kanye loves Christ !
Kanye West for PRESIDENT. Why? He’d be the first non-pedophile president in the history of the United States of America.

NO PERMACH BAN

Glad to see you rising up!  God is good...
This music video gives me Can't tell me nothing vibes.
Must be quite meaningful to have his father see the fruits of his labor, especially after he lost his mother.  Happens to almost all children, when you realize that your pillars wither, crumble and decay... Like everything else...😢
"But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?" Now 36 million gettin played on YT, oh yay, keep goin YZ, the foot steps your stepping ain't easy. Your getting played and people are getting saved!
Ye. Though you walk through the valley, you shall fear no evil. The devil will come to tempt you, He will throw some of us in chains. Be faithful be courageous the winepress will squeeze out the elect and bring forth the first fruits in due season.
Kali Uchis sent me
❤️❤️❤️
i love it! Kanye is an artist. He is doing it the right way now! Jesus be the glory!
Kyne excelente trabajo gran álbum,esto es lo que necesita el mundo😍😍😍🙏🙏
who  watching it cause of Sherp ATV?
I’m thankful to God I found this song before it was to late to make things right with my father. Kanye is the only one spitting truth
Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you.

Kanye always had Jesus (or a higher power).  I'm glad he played the game... Until he was able to make his own rules.  Glad he Leaned In... And outsmarted the 'rulers'
what did i miss
Welcome Home an Introduction to Righteousness Paperback – June 21, 2015

by    Nathanyel Ben Israel    (Author)
Everything goes to there own heaven but even zodiac nonsense people
Big ups to Johnny Frierson aka Kahfala Ojora for writing and singing the hook and helping Kanye with the whole concept of his album. 
You said Johnny passed away years ago?
Well big ups 2 Kanye for having the foresight to steal it.
1:40 wrestling with GOD I don't really want to Wrestle.
Why can't he get the most view in YouTube history when he rap for GOD 😪😪
👌
A BLACK MAN?
Follow Jésus
JESUS IS HAPPY THAT YOU CONVERTED KANYEEE!!! GOD BLESS YOU ABUNDANTLY AND MARY AND ST. MICHAEL INTERCEDE FOR YOU!!!!
Kanye is the good crazy
牛逼
Это по-моему украинцы эти вездеходы делают?
I’m not sure if Kanye is on his mood swing shit but he still a musical genius
What a song!
I don't know Jay-Z is his father....
I love god 🙏
See you in 2021
Le retour 12/08/2020
2011 Kanye: I sold my soul to the Devil. I know it was a crappy deal.. least it came with a few toys like a happy meal."
2019 Kanye: Jesus is King.


Something spooked the *hell* out of him. 😱
1:08 when your home alone and jamming to your playlist
Wtf was that kanye what's wrong with u. What did they do to you brother
2013 : Yeezus

2019 : Jesus is King
the way he looks at his dad at the end like "did you see that dad", and his father is just smiling like "dis shit fire boi"
can't wait for the comments in five years talking about how Kanye was ahead of his time.
Очень па християнски
Kanye: Smiling
Everyone: *Confused screaming*
I wish I had a relationship with my dad 
Glad to see Kanye west with his pop's
Keep it up ye. I love watchin this journey of yours. Ignore the hate. And always stay prayed up 🙏🏾
Plz, good journalist should ask Kanye whether he likes fishstick or not in presidency debate
I’m so happy for him. I hope he continues in this way.
✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️ JESUS IS KING
I have my disagreements with Kanye but damn, the dude can make music. That ending is so touching, too.
1:08 
Cameraman- Your facing the wrong way 

Kanye- No I'm not
"One of our ranches."
If that isn't the biggest flex I've ever heard...
sipppp bangets
Kept on replaying, who else thinks the song is too short?😭
God has given him a gift and now he’s using it for good
YE’ changes the game with every project
1:09 

MV director: “Kanye the camera is over here!”

Kanye: (Done rapping and dancing) *“What?!”*
“It took me 40 years to find out my father was my best friend” 
Those are some words there
is that the christian version of OTIS ?
“it took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend”
dads will forever be a sons best friend
At this point I've heard this album so many times its almost weird it doesn't automatically start playing "Closed on Sunday" after the scream
“And he will turn The hearts of the fathers to the children, And the hearts of the children to their fathers...” Malachi 4:6
Me: "this song is dope as hell"
Kanye: "we don't do that here"
He told me it ain't Christ-like
 but Nobody tell u when bein like Christ..
He's sincerely broke through the membrane of our cultures distortion matrix in a way no one else could
kanye’s dad: *opens the car door*

my brain: GRAND THEFT AUTO GRAND THEFT AUTO

Kanye sounds like he’s got his mojo going again. 😎 Dope video too. I liked how he had his back turned, he really keeps things interesting visually too.
Powerful message in the end about it taking him 42 years to realize his dad was his best friend.
Didn’t he sell his moms soul to the devil ?
kik
Everyone: 40 acres and a mule
Kanye: 4000 acres and that massive off-road thing
(message at the end of video) Kanye's dad replied with these three words: "A black man?". Think about that deeply and get the message. You are not limited by the color of your skin, but by your mind. Do not let people talk you into being a victim.
Youtubers: go dark
Kanye: go *LIGHT*
Jai shree ram
"A black man" I felt that. Only some will get it.
Jesus is the way to life only
Kanye pulled out the Jesus Zhaba
Back-to-back YouTube commercials ain’t Christ-like.
A   man that living his life with his best friend  and the best friend  is his pop.
I’m not religious but l gotta admit the beat is fire.
funny fact their no swearing
Damn I haven’t seen Kanye rapping with his back turned in a hard minute shit almost brought tears to my eyes son proud fan
Kanye: *drives*
Kanye's father: That's not christ like.
“A BLACK MAN?”     Reading those words at the end was my Favorite part of the video
Does anyone else see this video as a sequel to Otis? In Otis, he strips down a luxury car and rides around with his then best friend and models. This time, he’s on a ranch driving farm equipment with his dad just enjoying nature and life.
This is the *"They see me rollin'"* I never asked for, but God gave it.
I never thought in 2019 everyone would love Kanye West
tfs
love kanye
"It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend". Damn that's powerful. ✌
I’m not religious but this song slaps
I was screamin at my dad and he told me it aint Christ like, but no one ever tells you when your like Christ.
First time: what is this?
Second time: that ain't Christlike
Third time: STRETCH MY HANDS TO YOU
He inspires me to be a jesus rapper not a Christian rapper not a baptist rapper a not a methadost rapper but a Jesus rapper
I  REALLY appreciate what Kayne Is doing now. Finally, we have an artist who is choosing to do good with their platform that doesn't always promote guns, violence, sex, and drugs. Most artists just follow what's hot and whats traditional because people like drama and glorifying it literally trains your mind to live in that way and in that mindset which isn't good for your soul. Thank God, for Kayne's breakthrough! Love God <3 <3
"I tell God I'll be back in a second" well he wasn't lying
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I now present you our new National Anthem”
how may acres is this?
4000
a black man!?
After Kayne converted, from what I see in the comment section, he's changed lives. Jesus is king!
Welcome Neighbor. Stay strong your a great Dad. In life its all that matters.
I love this album... It's powerful, full of God's power. Blessings to you!
"This is like a movie but it's really very lifelike" - kanye amadues west- Damn as always he was before his time perfectly predicting 2020 almost a year before
For this guy with a son, this is incredibly moving. The love and respect for his father is so apparent.
Kanya finally gave his life to Chris let's go
1:03 . People on that plane in the background: hey look im in the video
Wow amazing song! But I wanna give some recognition to the filming of this video!! It's just wow!! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Jesus in Heaven : ayo turn that up
It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend"
They usually are, but these young generation is too stupid to realize that...Is never too late.
And now hes on a rant about how his dad almost decided to abort him
This is what he needs to cure
Wish this song was longer, the vibe. So good✌🏻✨😌
Is it just me or does the beginning of the song kinda sounds like Jimmy Hendrix???
Wish he overcomes the sickness, my mom had bipolar I wouldnt have wished that sickness on my worst enemy
I believe tht what has happened to Kanye is the awakening of his soul, and really no on was prepared for this to happen... Please stop calling him crazy..  To all you crazies please listen..... 💯
damn i love fishing too lol sometimes i wish he would see this and i would take him
My dad was my best friend too he was watching out for me and I’ve been screwing up my life for 9 yrs now but I finally have my life back toghether
How all now I don't hear him saying anything about follow God ?
🦉☄️ С МЕТЕОРИТА ПО ФИЛИНУ= однозначно💪🏻
he has such a beautiful smile. This my shit
The greatest gospel artist of all time.
A father is always the best friend , he stay's with me until the end.
Me as 36 and my father at 87 year's is every moment where I thank God for.
Man, Brother, Kanye.  You are so loved. we all go thru shit , then the sun rises or sunsets. Every day is blessed. Cheers bruv. Peace,Love and Health to you and your family.   Cheers, Louise.
So this video is Kanye's take on Death Stranding, interesting
True peace comes from God alone through His Son Yeshua (Jesus Christ). Simply say and believe ..Yeshua, Lord Jesus Christ, forgive me of my sins, wash me clean. I accept you as saviour,  restore my life, help me. I believe you rose from the dead. Choose righteousness
Watching Kanye move~ made me smile 😊
It took me 21 years to realise that my brother was my best friend☺
God says draw close to me and I will draw close to u remember Kanye his Mercy goes a long way as from East to West n North and south God is love stay woke my g
I think Jesus trying to work through you❤️
That's that gta online truck n shit
This is bumping perfect song to get you going in the morning
God's blessings Brother.
I wish this song was longer... I have keep listening to it over & over. 😂😉👍
NO PUDDLES💯®
I hope Kanye is ok :(
I hope kanye gets through this
this my fav kanye song, wish it was longer, because it is like a snippet. This dude is flipping talented dunno why he has been tripping lately but god bless this dude much love. I like you way better than jayz.
I just ordered my Kayne West for President stickers for the car...
Can't wait until they arrive.
The YAHUA are with you! Don't Down, but give Up!
Closed on Sunday , You my Chic fil a

Coming here after his rally, songs way more powerful
We need an extended version..
Get the message & avoid criticism. I love the message of the song!
Kanye be making gospel sound cool ✌🏻 Praise God
I always judged my dad, but I see now that he was facing the same demons that I'm facing in my life now. We still butt heads every time we meet but I love the man and I see that he was going through as a man and not just as my father, but as his own man
Stay strong and Blessed Kayne...
This song is amazing tho!!!!!
Kanye: god is 👍
Rap devil: U FOOL!
1:36 damn that's smooth 🔥💯
I love you kanye your ALWAYS in my prayers you could NEVER do anything to look bad in my eyes
Sherp - manufacturer of all-terrain amphibious vehicles
Kanye is a genius.. when it comes to music. I feel so much for him currently. He is clearly in pain. I pray he gets help. He needs to return from the sunken place. We need him back.
Great that Kanye is differing from all the other artist who preach sin and the message of the devil! Notice in this song, when you speak of God, the music is almost sinless. No cursing, no twerking, no lust. May God bless Kanye!
Praying for him🙏🙏
Anyone from the midwest who knows what the gravity of having your own land to fuck around on and know what that means, understands what this video means. Big ups to Kanye for investing in what matters. 4k acres.
what the author had in mind?:)))
#KANYE GODS GOT US BROTHER DONT LET THE WORLD NOR BLOOD DECEIVE YOU FROM THE POWER OF LOVE FROM GOD. THE ONE AND ONLY WAY IS JESUS WE GOT YO BACK YE
<3
I didnt know god had Instagram
Kanye, they hate u cause u r with god, that‘s the only reason! Be strong brother! God is with us! AMEN

No entiendo el ingles :(
This man found reason and peace, took time to spite the violence of the world and people will still shit on him for speaking his mind and showing human emotion at a rally.
God is picking his warriors for the war that awaits.
TELL ME WHAT UR LIFE LIKE
okay now im starting to think kanye became christian so more people would vote for him in the election
🙏🏻
anyone else notice the "Otis" comparisons?
THANKS. FOR SHARING.MR.KANYE WEST LOVE FROM INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮 👌👍💕💕💕
You Have My Vote !
4000 acres and a mule so cool, the hardest shit from kanye  teaching the golden rule.
Only good song on the album
This a different kinda flex ! Kanye different
regardless if you believe him or not his action speaks louder than his lyrics, JESUS IS KING
Only crazy this nigga is, is crazy talented.
He was doing so good
Nobody never realizes it till it's to LATE!!!
How can you sell your soul, and try to worship God?
That squawk @ 2:14 was something else 😂😂

JESUSISKING AMEN 🙏
THANK YOU KANYE!
The best of BEST OF BEST PERIDOT
🖖🏻
Dyamn it should be long
Now, This is Old Skool.
I'm praying for you Kanye West.  God's got this, never forget that!  It is frustrating to see that they will not wake up to see what is the Truth.  I see it Kanye.  You are not crazy.  You are being used by God as a messenger.  Message:  Get Christ-like and Repent for ALL your sins. 
GENESIS 1 (DRA)
Kanye: follow god
Kanye: basically follow me

I knew it the God is my only friend my creator nothing else matters all the worldly possessions won't go with you when God calls, you better go ....no hesitation
I'm so happy he came to his senses and became a Christian
Not gonna lie. This is actually a bop.
Through the Wire and the circuits
It’s the A.I. Kanye... I got u bro... Archangel Michael... the voices... give it to me, I’ll finish it.
even those who follow GOD can lose their way
Good to know that Kanye turns to Jesus
Too bad this is the only song I like from this album 😩

Kanyes auto biography
My dad cleared it wtf
Anyone can say they are Christian 🤷🏾‍♀️but few follow,  obey, and love walking in the word of God! Christian is just a title! But are you truly a child of God? There’s a difference
Yeezus
well the king dead
God loves u and vote ye
i'll never forgive you for what you do in 2009 vmas and your song famous!!!
Kanye was embarrassed to dance like how he really wanted when his dad was next to.him lol
Damn, Jay-Z looks so old here
His dad looks like he has genuine love for his son and it is really cool. This video hit harder than any number of twerking girls
Real talk, I love how Kanye is not afraid of being real to the worlds
But nobody never tell you when you being like christ 💯
the new Kanye : that ain't christ like 
the old Kanye : I said ahhhh !!!!
Kanye West is not crazy THEY WANT  YOU TO BELIEVE HE IS CRAZY
Ye's dad with that smile. So proud of His boy. Imagine how proud Jesus is of this "Black man". I shed a tear when I read that line. Im a white man and my dad was never in my life. Aint matter what color, this is real. Human and Christ like. Blessings, Kanye.
“Instead of creating your own footprints, walk in the footprints I’ve already made” 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"A Black Man?" Yes sir, A Black MAN in Christ.
Kanye is back gave me the old hip hop flavour🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't believe in god, but I believe in this god damn beat.
Praise the Lord for Kanye’s salvation. I pray God will keep him strengthened and encouraged
Guat is your neme
Others: You can't do a music rap about Jesus

Kanye West: Hold my Bible.
This shit just hits different.  Kanye still got it and he’s a boss.  I listened to this song about 50 times already it just bangs in such a crazy way.  Can’t explain it
“Kanye crazy” -GOD
This song reminds me a lot of old Kanye and I love it
Jesus christ pbuh says in gospel of john chapter 14 verse 28 'my father is greater than I'. Gospel of john chapter 10 verse 29 'my father is greater than all'. Gospel of matthew chapter 12 verse 28 'I cast out devils by the spirit of God'. Gospel of Luke chapter 11 verse 20 'I with the finger of God cast out devils'. Gospel of john chapter 5 verse 30 'I can of my own do nothing. As I hear I judge and my judgment is just. For I seek not my will but the will of my father'. Gospel of matthew chapter 19 verses 16-17 a man comes to Jesus and says 'oh Good Master what good things should I do so that I can enter eternal life' . Jesus replied 'why are you calling me good there is only one good that is the God in the heaven. If you want to enter eternal life then you keep the commandments' . Here Jesus has made a clear difference between himself and God. Do you still believe in trinity then you're not following Bible and Jesus christ. Do you know this word trinity doesn't exist anywhere in the Bible. But it is in the Quran. Quran says in surah al Nisa chapter 4 verse 171 'don't say trinity. Stop it. It is better for you'. Also in surah al ma'aidah chapter 5 verse 73 'those are doing kuf(rejecting) who says that Allah(God) is a triune God is a three in one God'. Jesus says in gospel of john chapter 16 verse 12-14 'I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now. For he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth. He shall not speak of himself all that he hear shall he speak he shall glorify me'. Now I'm asking you a simple question who was the person who came after Jesus and has glorified Isa(Jesus) and has claimed prophet hood. It was no one but prophet Muhammad pbuh. Prophet Muhammad pbuh was the only prophet who has glorified Jesus pbuh. In the old testament in the book of Isaiah chapter 29 verse 12 'the book will be given to him who's not learned and will be said read this and he'll say I'm not learned'. This is exactly when the angel Gabriel came to Muhammad for the first time Gabriel said Iqra(read) then Muhammad replied manabiqari(I'm not learned). So if you want to be a true Christian then you'll have to follow Muhammad pbuh and quran what was given to Muhammad pbuh. Muhammad pbuh is the last and final messenger sent by Almighty God. After him no messenger is gonna come. The bible never said that Jesus pbuh is the last prophet but the bible continues to prophet muhammad pbuh. And Quran was the revolution from God that was given to Muhammad pbuh. The coming of prophet muhammad pbuh is prophesied in all the major world religious scriptures if you want proof then you can watch the video of Dr zakir naik in YouTube 'Muhammad pbuh in various world religious scriptures | Dr zakir naik | Full lecture. May Allah guide all of you. Ameen.
It's deep when you realize his new found relationship with his Father in heaven, in relation to his rediscovered relation to his earthly father.

“Bro did you really just start eating before grace” - Kanye
pokimane
what is the dislikes compared to the likes that's how you have to look at your life
I’m sure people thought Kanye was insane when he spoke about Christ and church. Look what he has become.
he looks more happier and at peace now God bless you Kanye
Fav Kanye track track right here man let's make him the president of America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
“you’re such fricken christian...i love it “
Kaney for president!!!
This is exactly what the Christian music need more creative peices of music
It’s my birthday today, so I’d like to consider this a gift from God
#GodisKing
who else remembers Kanye West saying he is gonna run for president in 2020?
Edit : yes I know he also said 2024 but in a vine long ago he said 2020.
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord
The length of the track ain’t Christ-like
“Only he has words of eternal life.... Whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life”
Kim won’t though
The reason this song hits so hard is because it’s the power of GOD
imagine jesus resurrecting with this in the background.
The length of this song isn’t Christ like.
"I was looking at the comments and I don't even like likes".....
"Aaaaaaaaah"
-Kanye West 2019
Kanye pido a Dios por ti y tu familia.... paz y amor ,, como Dios lo anhela.
“This is like a movie but it’s really very life-like...”
I love this, the authenticity, the old kanye vibes with the new kanye mind. Glory be to God! 🙏 🙏
"A black man?"....y'all don't even know how powerful that is
All the dislikes really ain't Christlike.
It’s so beautiful seeing 
Kanye with his father
Christians: We need good Christian rap. 

Kanye: Hold my oblivious llama and donkey in frame...
Yes I will follow God forever.. For He is above all powers, above all kings. Above all nature and all created things. Above all wisdom  and all the ways of man. For He was here before the world began. Above all kingdoms, above all thrones. Above all wonders the world has ever known. Above all wealth and treasures of the earth. There's no way to measure what He's worth...it's a song I like to listen a thousand times again. Because of the reality of the lyrics if you know God through experiences and favors and blessings received.
Is them vehicles from Tesla?
Ye's father: this ain't christ like




Ye: 2:13
Amen
Hating a man that found a reason to love life when he has all the  money is a bum move. Keep it up Kanye.
I heard this song and played it 8 times or so in a row, Just a few months ago i was screaming at my Dad. I called him today for the first time since. Ty
Honestly it doesn’t really matter whether you believe in god or not but please keep your negative opinions to yourself. If you believe in him that’s fine and if you don’t that’s fine too.
#JESUSISKING
Your not just a black man Kanye, your a child of God and with him anything is possible. God bless you and your family.
I'm from 2023 , the president make so good music.
I hope people get it, there's more after this life---------I was a doubter too, now happier then I've ever been. Give God a chance.
I´M YELLING MR. KANYE WEST FOR PRESIDENT!

If you see a guy dancing with his hands on his hips with the other hand waving, you should know that this is a Kanye West video 🤣🤣
I still can’t stop blasting this track 🔥
The more I listen to this album the more I'm starting to think he believes in god
The intro about walking in the snow is a childhood memory I have that I forgot about. This song made me cry
Kanye (you'll never read this, but hey, I'll post it anyway), you never had my support when you were ensconced in the world, but following Yeshua, your my brother now. Endure to the end!
Thank you Kanye, this is what we need right now.  THIS IS THE MEDICINE!!! Thank you. May God continue to lift you up as you deliver his message to the people. AMEN!!! 💗💗💗💗

YES SURE
YEEZY 2020!
KANYE 2020!!!!
Honestly, I'd consider voting for him if he comes out with solid policy. So far, he's second worst on policy but best in personality.
Coming back to this album in 2020 is great. I realize that I don’t like most songs for the flow but for the meaning.
His dad looks like Jay Z, maybe that's why before he was so drawn to him.
You are running for president.❤😊 I will have to start calling you joesph 😊😂go for it and always remember joesph loves everyone .the dream coat one 😊👍peace xxx❤❤❤ I love you and kim .xxx❤❤❤

I really wanna see Kanye in a candidates debate. I think he would do well.
When Trump gets re-elected he will give Kanye a position in office. Watch. 
Obama did it for Kumar, who is a smart man in his own right, so don't say it can't happen. Kanye is brilliant.
The mainstream anything just hates the slightest sense of individuality.

“A black man? “

                        -Kanye’s Dad
Dope
Seeing Kanye West smiling while with his dad is a rare sight
Old Kanye: I am God.
New Kanye: I love God.
This song reminds me of him and jay song Ottis. 💪🏿💪🏿
Dont care what the haters talking Ye is still my dude
I’m confused. I haven’t liked anything Kanye’s done in a long, long time. This was dope.
"A black man?"

"No Dad, 4000."
„4000 acres!“ „a black man?“🙏🏽
The only problem with this song is that it's too damn short.
"it took me 42 years to realize that my Dad was my best friend"


I FELT THAT SHIT.
Do not hold people back for what they have done in the past, instead look forward to see what has changed about them
“Wrestling with god I don’t really wanna wrestle” this line goes so hard
Never thought I would see the day a Christian song off an album literally called “JESUS IS KING” would be trending at number one on YouTube
Kanye: *breaths*


Kanye's Dad: "That ain't christ-like "
This is “Hey Mama” but for his dad
The bible it read the antichrist will come from the WEST kanye West
Kanye 2013 : I’m a god

Kanye 2019 : Jesus is king. 

.....................that’s personal growth.
trumpet = trump, kanye and trump b angels yall. God told em hes sending trump
I'm starting to love Kanye..
Kanye rap God
The problem with this song is that it has an end.
Amennn
For a big artist like Kanye to Change and make this album, It's obviously going to help those who listens to Kanye west. Some will follow Jesus and some will not but that's how it works. The seed has been planted.
Kanye 2011: Otis 
Kanye 2019: follow god
Kanye is too gangsta He can only beef with the devil.
It’s like he returned to where he began. He started with Jesus Walks as his first big hit
There isn't a man more American than Kanye West.
If you’re reading this have a blessed 2019 and 2020!
My dad was on heroin.. Appreciate ur dad if he is in ur life💯💯💯
This is the kanye we want! More of this! The flow and lyricism and meaning!
Kanye & Twenty one pilots... Now.
I was screaming at my dad and he told me it ain't Christ like
❤️
Probably the best song on jesus is king
Kanye is the kind of guy that takes 42 years to realize his dad is his best friend
Kanye The Fool
Damn. After this song. I went to church and  gave my soul to the lord.
Nice great maurice
His Dad was talking like he was reading out of the Bible
Wishing you all the good Luck and more blessings for becoming the President of America. You and your wife and Kids and whole family is a blessing! Greetings from (white)Germany ;-)
“A black man?” 

Legend.
This some Bound 2 level future flow aesthetic. People in 2024 be like “we didn’t know how good this video was”
Never thought a song called "follow God" would be number 1 on trending. Things are changing for the better.
Next president 👀
turned my yeezys into Jesus sandals while listening
To the person reading this
I pray that god remove all burden off your shoulders😊
We, as Christians, can’t judge one another’s legitimacy to the faith. There’s only one judge of that.
Kanye Who’s your Daddy !! Trumps waiting to console you after the election, good news is, he has a job for Kim in the Oval Office 😁 The OG Paradise !
We often sensationalize so much negativity from Hip-Hop music, that it's kinda awkward when it's positive. Congrats Ye for the change!🙏🏽🔥
amazing beat ngl
This is hot. One of the anthems of 2020, along with This is America.
next level devil worshiper Kanye acting like he worships God
If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.

2 Chronicles 7:14
Brasileiros?
Lol yaso3

#SN61614 ... we love you bro
KANYE FOR PRESIDENT. SIR YES SIR. 2020.......................................
Aye bruh good for Kanye. He found God, and he’s makin bangers off of gods word!
Happy Father's day to all my black dads taking care of their kids.
I started drinking when I was 16. I would
drink at parties, but I also started drinking alone because I was unhappy, and
I was in a lot of emotional pain all the time. My mom was very aggressive when
I was younger, and my brother hated her and so did I. He started hanging out
with shady people, he started failing all his classes, he was never home, and
my parents fought all the time. I also ran away several times. I was always
trying to figure out a reason as to why I was here or what the purpose of life
was. So, I started looking at different philosophies, religions, and beliefs. When
I was 18 after I was hungover, I got on my knees and I prayed for the first
time. I asked if God was real that he would show me he was real because I
couldn’t take it anymore. I was crying when I prayed for this. At that moment I
felt a presence come over me like a wind. It was barely noticeable, but it was
unlike anything in my life I had experienced up until that point. I was
surprised when I felt it and I remember saying “what was that?” after that
experience I pretty much forgot what happened and kept partying, until my
senior year when I got arrested. After my arrest, my parents lost all their
trust in me and I was expelled from high school. I was told never to come back.
At that time, I felt afraid and hopeless. That’s when I started looking for God,
and I prayed that he would reveal himself in my life and that he would give me
signs. My prayers began getting answered so consistently that I couldn’t deny
that God was doing something. It was mysterious and compelling. I ended up in
Church and started reading the bible hours a day. I stopped hanging out with
all my other friends because they were continually getting arrested. I was able
to forgive my family and myself and to ask to be forgiven. I noticed how at
Church people were judgmental and how they formed cliques but were afraid to be
around anyone else different from them. It increased my faith because I
realized Jesus was not like that and ever since I was young, I saw people as
people regardless of who they were. After a while, it’s like I could see God's
presence was in my life and then it felt like he wasn’t, and then he was, and
then he wasn’t. One day I woke up and felt more depressed than I ever have in
my entire life. I felt like I was dying on the inside. That night I prayed, and
I said, God, I don’t see my life five years from now I'm going to die Jesus
save me Lord, please save me. I was weeping when I said it and when I asked him
to save me, I felt a presence inside of me like a heartbeat, and I felt it once
like a pulse, and I said Lord please save me and I felt it again even stronger.
It was like radiance. When I woke up the next morning, I had transformed
everything felt brand new like I was a kid again. All my fears and all my
racing thoughts everything was gone. I looked at my hands, and I said this
can’t be real it’s impossible. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I saw a
different person. I started praying, and the holy spirit became entirely real
to me it was washing over me and inside of me. It was total love and peace, and
I heard a voice but not an audible one, it was an inner voice. It said I am
with you; I love you, I will never leave you, it’s done it’s finished. That was
May 3rd, 2009, and ever since then I’ve followed God, I have seen many things
change and many things I know wouldn’t have changed without faith and belief. I
know what it’s like to be lost to feel you have no hope. Don’t ever think
you’re stuck, or life can’t change because it can. My mom is a Christian now,
Its night and day. Some of the things that went away during that period were
severe anxiety and my addiction to alcohol. I’ve seen and experienced so many
things that are miraculous and seen how God has worked in my life. When we ask
God to forgive us for what we’ve done and turn away from our sins and wrongdoings
and we believe in Christ's sacrifice everything changes. His word says if we
confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that he
died and rose again we will have eternal life but not just life after death but
abundant life in the present. Our sins are erased not only past, present, and
future but our burdens and fears are lifted also. Our thoughts, our minds, our
hearts, our souls are transformed and united with God and we know his spirit
lives in us. If you seek, pray, and knock you will know JESUS IS KING!!! HE
LIVES!
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like type write
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like excite bike (stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three a piece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, I've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my dad (stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Aah"
Everybody gangsta till Kanye and his dad pulled up with the Jesus Tank™
Indeed, Christ is king! Jesus gave his life that others may live, praise be to Jehovah God!
Why isn’t anyone talking about how Kanye was vibing in the RUNE zhaba from gta v
Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity. 1 John 2:17  KJV, NKJV ❤️👑✝️📖
i had to go back to this after listening to wash us in the blood
I jumped out of my seat when I saw he named a song on this album “Selah.”
One of my favourites from this album!
🙏good hearts, I am what I am thanks to you,  all pure souls💞
Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. He died for our sins so that we can have eternal life; because there is sin in this world, there is death.
Music producer: So, how much drum kick do you want?

Kanye: Yes
Thank you for doing this to Christian music, you’re doing what no one else can.
he needs to guide other rappers to Jesus before it’s to late 🤷🏻‍♀️ , well um like those who haven’t sold their souls i guess.
Everyday i pray for keny west.. i love keny west
Hallelujah to Jesus the king of kings!
I love almost all genres of music. But I have never in my 53 years of life enjoyed rap - until now. This really sounds good. Not just the words for Christ, but the music. 
Kanye, I know God has HUGE plans for you in this state, country and the world -  right now!!  We needed you so desperately. I can't thank-you enough.
This song is so 🔥
1:22 rare sighting *Kanye West smiling*
How I feel when I'm arguing with my mom at the end!
Thanks for making me build houses even when I'm homeless
Kanye West be riding in a Mars Rover 🔥🔥🔥
I sold my soul to the devil I know it was a crappy deal but it comes with a few toys like a happy meal, 
Remember this Kanye?
Pray, pray and pray, the nation of the USA needs prayer and repentance👏💯💯💯💯
"Father I stretch my hands to thee"
 Check out how Vanessa Bell Armstrong sing it. It will bless you.
Bro Kanye, this song kicking man. Keep it up.
kanye working on awakening the sleepers
17 And he was teaching saying to them.”Has it not been written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.’ ”
“A black man?” <3
Best kwest song! Straight bars!!
Thank you Lord ❤️🙏🏼
Here I am like CYN I'LL STILL HAVE ME (:
I'm back on Team Yeezy!

Just doing a bit of wheeling in the SHERP!
This album made me re-think my religion (I overall didn’t but still, it did”
Awww I love this
That message in the beginning was so accurate tbh
cool man, awesomeness... follow God! watching from the Philippines
He told me that ain't christlike but no one ever telling you when you christlike hm
Love Kanye for this album!
Southern part ocean
jesus is real different and special and so kanye told god, damn you out here you on bandcamp?
Life was better when this came Out
"A black man?"
This man has constantly reinvented himself and has managed to stay relevant in different Eras .. goat for a reason
When I pray, I don’t typically get the “AHAHAHHAHAAAA”. Unless we go to my wife’s mom’s church that’s Pentecostal then it’s like Kanye “AHAHahUhhaha” all over!  Actually, “I love it” 😏 #DadJokes
The dancing though 😂
I thought the man in the video was Morgan Freeman
Truely(im moving baxk and fotwatd(MENE MENE!)
Songs don’t have to have cusses to be GOOD!!!!
If anyone ever understood me its kanye and Mel Gibson 🔥 wake up ❤
KAWYNE west who's your GOD
I love you brother. I pray that you remain in God's favor for all eternity. Amen.
2020 jamming 💯😘😷🤑🔥🙏🤷‍♂️

#amentogodblesspathonyourjourneyuniverse😇👣🌌🖤 #amenigivethanksGod😇👣🌌🖤
Beyond 40 acres and a mule this man I swear
Cody Wyoming is beautiful country!
I knew someday Kanye would become a Christian and release a Christian rap album and that day came *i think a year ago but idk* but anyway thx man and God bless
God bless, Jesus loves all of you
This is a really cool song!!!!
32k dislikes are from unholy people 🤦‍♂️😤
I dont get that starting metaphor, don't think for yourself?
Just getting my Kanye fix.
I thought the other guy is Denzel Washington
EVERYONE! VOTE FOR KANYE
I would love to have that land
Kanye playing hill climb racing in 3D. 😂😂
Amazing song, beautiful cinematography, and inspiring speech in beginning.. 
BUT
Something doesn’t seem right with the whole “Don’t make your own foot prints, follow the ones I’ve created” or somethin. Idk, I’m agnostic but I understand the religious context behind it and respect that. I think the only thing with me is, why wouldn’t you want your kids to create their own? I don’t mean the literal walking in snow foot prints. Idk. Just me
How did this get any dislikes??
ok, im jealous he has a Russian snow buggy. those are cool.
i dont believe in god but i love this album
One of the best songs ever
🔥🔥🔥
Officially the richest “rapper”  in the world!! Kanye is a 🐐
Kanye and Donald Glover should do a collab IT WOULD HIT HARD.
Wrestling with God and I don’t really want to wrestle
Kanye did dmt and you can tell it was so fucking good for him
what kind of vehicle is that👀🤯
Gracias Kanye West!!
The screaming will stop.
1:35 gta V zhaba
I'll be honest, I haven't listened to anything from Kanye. I'm just dropping by to see what kind of people are. If you're a Christian, you are part of the call to reach your neighbor with the Gospel.  I was just wanting to reach out and offer my service to help you with super easy ways to do that.  I've got lots to show on my channel.
This is underrated. Period.
Bro I f***ing love Kanye
Omg my favorite song

What happened to the old Kanye West?! He hasn’t been the same since he got with Kim Kardashian. He’s really just played out now.
❤️🙏🏽

Kanye west!!bring back the real hip hop
Praise JESUS CHRIST!!! KING of kings LORD of lords!!! God is opening our eyes and he’s using some of our favs 💕🙏🏽
Dopeeeeeeeeeed

Im excited to see God!
Because I think he is cooler than anyone else here!
John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
Yo I love this Kanye
He is distracting the devil
Who see that zhaba tho 😳
After a long day of work, Kanye West goes to his Kanye Nest to take his Kanye Rest. He wakes up feeling his Kanye Best. Then he’ll get Kanye Dressed on his Kanye Vest to go on a Kanye  Quest. He goes to church and becomes Kanye Blessed, then to a hotel room to be a Kanye Guest. He goes to school to take his Kanye Test. He forgot to brush his teeth. Did he run out of Kanye Crest? His neighbor stole it, what a Kanye Pest.
This shit bang
Ta chida la rola no le entiendo pero mucho comentario en ingles denle like si tampoco les entienden jajaja
Not even cancel culture was able to stop kanye.... like he said before, "If I'm afraid to be me, I'm not longer 'Ye"
If only donda was there too 😔
thank u.
I'm sorry for judging you Kanye, for God does not judge, I finally listened to the album and realized that there was no foolery going on, you really do Love JESUS, Much Love from me and Elevate Life Church out in Riverside CA, All Praise To The Most High KING JESUS!!!! you are my Brother
Good music Kanye I deff felt this.
We need Kanye in canada
kanye is amazing
this joint knockin
All who listen to Kanye west's music and appreciate the work.
I want to take a moment to say that you should pray that he does not have a divorce.
Let's agree together , here . 
I break the power of the devil , I break his spirit of divorce in this man life . I speak fruitfulness , I speak unity , I speak faithfullnes over their relationship and I give the devil a headache. In the name above all names , in the unmatchable name of Jesus Christ the son of man and king of kings . Yeshua be in your relationship I put the blood of Jesus over your relationship , your wife and your children. Gogogo
Nice won Kanye god bless all
Keep dissin the devil kanye😎😎😎
Me and the boys heading to the buyers on the casino heist
Amen.

#KanyeWest 2020! First Comment Bih
This feel like the Old Kanye.
32k people not making to heaven for sure.
#JESUSISKING
no comment
Kanye west with Morgan Freeman
Here listening to christian music so jesus can stop the pandemic they technically started up there just so their people can say thank you once it stops when scientists figure it out.
No thanks
My reaction as soon as it zoomed out to reveal the jesus tank:


LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!
True and also you are your best friend that's what hes trying to instill in you so when he's gone you can stay strong never weak and thatsa word from the wise with the flo like a creek kinda slow but staying cold is the only way to spot fake and if they don't like it kick rox
Say what you want about Ye but if you think he fell off then you haven't been paying attention.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the cinematography.Its just beautiful
Dad: stop playing that!
Son: why?
Dad: we have bigger speakers at church!
My goodness.  Not religious, but he blessed that beat.
Keep thinking Kanye will lose his touch - it’s never gonna happen
So Kanye is one of the two witnesses
I'm huge fan of Kanye and I think that's so beautiful that he finally found a calm place in his state of mind
Kanye’s dad when Kanye starts spazzing on him: that wasn’t very Christlike of you
Dope
Kanye Follow God and MC SMOOK WASSER have the best Beats and Music Videos of 2019
I love to see God working in and thru Kanye. I believe God chose Kayne because he has always been outspoken( regardless of pushback or backlash) , he used to have anger issues and now I see a content peaceful mind and a man filled with Joy only God can give. He answered his calling and God is uplifting him to spread the word. In a way Kayne reminds me a lot of the Apostle Paul( once Saul). Keep spreading the word brother and may God continue to bless you and his will for you!
People who disliked the video ain't crist like
Directors: mr Kanye what do you need

Kanye: dad , a tank , and space
I’m so happy for Kanye these days. GOD really is GOOD.
Im so sorry God . Please forgive my sins.
Beautiful message and to see Kanye and his dad smiling having a good time is so wholesome!!! More of this.
Kanye 2020
That last part where kanye yelled gonna be a meme..
Good song, good message, coming from a man with issues. We all got issues. Any man who says they don’t is a liar. I’ve never liked Kanye the man, at least the public figure that we’ve all been exposed to, but I commend him for things like this. He’s on a mission of self discovery, and I deeply respect that.
Kanye follow where God is leading and make this song longer
“It took me 42 yrs to realize that my dad was my best friend.” 💔❤️
waooooooooooooooooo
Day 14: still haven’t taken a bath because I cant stop walking on water

/christlike
"it took me 42 years to realize my dad was my best friend" 
This can be taken both to mean his dad and his "father"(god
Camera man: camera is right behind you. 
Kanye: I'm yelling at the mountains.
Nobody:

God: *Chillin*

Kanye: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Albert Einstein-
"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. Society honors the faithful servant, and has forgotten about the gift"
kanye the goat
I need the jesus tank in gta
god is our dad
Just changed my opinion on Kanye West. This song is brilliant.
Some one asked me if I would vote Kanye For President 2024?
I said. “Ye”
“It took me 42 years to realize that my dad is my best friend” that went over many peoples heads.  He isn’t only talking about his earthly dad.
Wow! Never thought I'd see so much positive energy on Kanye's comment section, mad respect to everybody showing Love! Letting Ye do Ye!😍😍
Praise Jesus !! Thank you God for bringing Kanye back home ❤️

Everyone: Rap is devil music.

The prodigal son has returned.
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"

The best music video of our generation
Kanye doing the most
Good Job Kanye, you've come out of a place that most people could've never come out of.


 
Mark 11:25 – And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”
"Screaming at my dad and he told me it ain't Christ-like but nobody ever tell you when you being like Christ" Whewwww YE spittin bars and facts!
Yeah because flexing is Christ like
I love how there is just a fricken ALPACA and DONKEY in the back😂
How many acres is this?
Kanye: 4000
Dad: a black man
Me: 404 not found
this is what logic thinks his music sounds like
Kanye I’m so glad u turned to God ur a leader and disciple of God
When the darkest souls come to the light of god.... Those are his strongest soldiers...
“Jesus is king” is an instant classic. The sound is fresh and the lyrics meaningful and inspiring. Also the album cover is simple yet unique and memorable.
Jesus is the only true king in this world!
1:45 that little move he does then looks at his dad I know that feeling
This takes me back to the college drop out and graduation.
This song is really amazing to me!!!!
When.. Y'all get out of Purgatory I hope you match my energy cause i have yet to miss a beat.... I knew Good Friday was coming so you saw me on my best behavior trying to get out... Hate to amp but shit let me brush my mutha fuckin shoulders off
LOVE YOUR MUSIC, I LOVE GOD, JESUS AND MY LIFE (I FAIGHT ATHEISM SAME MONTHS AGO I BORN AGAIN)
What a message at the end was absolutely beautiful. Especially in times like today...
Kanye’s dad must be so be proud of his son and the man he has grown to be. 
Kanye is not the same man he was just a few years ago. He’s a student of life.... always evolving and growing and making each day an opportunity to teach and learn something new.
Beautiful!  Blessed to have that realization while your dad is still here to enjoy it with you brother!
someone needs to mix father stretch my hand part 1 and follow god
That conversation at the end with his dad. Did he record that too?
When you gonna put out a new album Kanye. The world needs more of this
RIP George Floyd
The devil somewhere saying this shit hit cuz of the beat.
God bless you thank you for kingdom 🎶 Music 🙌🏽
"I don't even like, likes!"

NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND KAYNES FRUSTRATION IN THAT SCREAM
other rappers: Buys Iced out AP-s etc
Kanye: I don’t wanna flex on ya'll but I bought me a mf mountain
biggest flex of 2019 NO CAP
If the intro was in the actual album, would have been, like an 8 out of 10 for me, and not 7
Nobody ever tell you when you being like Christ

Greatest musician to walk the earth. I don’t even really think it’s close at this point.
allah
best kanye song for me on repeat 2 days :D
Sick, broooooooo❤️❤️💋
Kanye we could use your voice in a time like this
You will search for me and you will find me, I'm here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and The last message from God is a The Hu Man The Supreme Being, I know everyone is perfect in my eyes, don't be fooled by The Devil's voice to teach you to lie, cheat or steal from someone you care about getting mad is a sin and getting angry is a curse.
this music videos are so wholesome :)
かっこよすぎるーー
Im lovin the flow
🧙‍♂️
@1:45..dope

This man driving the zhaba

Só vdd siga a deus
So glad for Kanye West 👏
💪🙏❤💯
Claims to follow and live with christ yet still makes the closing to the video about skin color, growth but he still dont really get it.
I thought he is sarcastic here. But, he’s not. Jesus is King!
Jesus is KING!

무신론자도 하느님을 믿게하는 그는... 갓...이져스....

Their are six points on a Star of David ✡️..... five points out of the six represents the god head, 4 god most high 1 deity most high, and the sixth point is creation. 5 becomes a total 1 the 4 lives in the nucleus(jah), neutron(the youth yeshua Ben Joseph), proton(ox Ben David selassie I), electron(Holy Spirit)prana image salvation.
Deity1 hair pores likeness Shiloh who is like god prince of host Moses nature 9 ether.
1 added on top of 6 equals 7 which means complete.
God is Good 💯
If kanye west is saying follow 
Then dont b mistaken he is roleplaying...
👑🗣
Hey mama , follow god
john legend
Follow god 33m views n words in paris 287m views y'all need Jesus
love this
This other time everything was so bad
It was really nuts, but some of us didn't forget God
Everything and everyone was against us
They put numbers on our skin, they beat us, they killed some of us, they tried to end us, they tried to take who we are, but some of us didn't forget God
Some of us said they tried too hard, some of us said they didn't try hard enough
We all know it was God who kept us in His hand to fight another day
The sun went down and the stars came up, another day
God kept us, some of us didn't forget God
We all know how cold the winter wind is when it blows
Slaves for hundreds of years, walked the desert with our little ones, lost some of loved ones to that regime, and shed our tears, but God saw ours tears and kept us
Then one day one  of us was crucified to save all of us, no can ever be Christ like
Kanye be getting all the ladies and angels in heaven
That shit in gta
is this is his dad?
Wyoming huh
Bro is he promoting Sherps tho?
The camera is on a drone

Apostasy!
*Gta 5 vechiles*
Only Kanye ❤️❤️❤️👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Soul assassin
It’s called zhamba
June 8-Kanye was born
NO QUESTION ASKED THIS SONG IS POWER
They need to create their own steps!!
Bamger
All we want to do is make our father proud.
Was that jay z
OK I am back to being on Kanye's jock like the old school
Whats that beginning song or is it just this song
God CANNOT use nothing of this WORLD !!!!🤩🥶🤑
Why don't people hear him spit FACTS
MELODIA ESPLENDOROSA IMAGEM IMPECAVEL PALETA DE CORES DIVINA
!!!!!!11
Thats why RAY J smashed first
I want to buy a car just for listening this song.
Beautiful
Kanye‘s song & MC SMOOK WASSER are the best this year
my advice is flee to Russia
Who else wish this song was longer🔥🔥😭💕
The number of times i have played this song on YouTube 

“It ain’t Christ like “
JESUS IS LORD 🙌🏼
Kanye is close to his mother again after finding God. Very happy for him.
No one can match this mans moves, I swear
Profound....actually I was in tears! I was brought up going to church every sunday.. I chose to live my own life...made a lot of bad choices along the way..my dad was always like a beacon that I ignored..my dad always talked to me about Jesus. I didn't want to be told how to live my life..now that I'm older and have a family of my own, I feel like I need to get right with God and lead my family on the right path..
"For what profits a man to gain the world and lose his soul in the process?"
-God
This song is so short!
Kanye: that ain’t even christ like
Kanye west is on fire
Your dad is truly your best friend. Took him 42 years to realize that...fashionably late I’m just glad he made it.
I used to miss the ol’Kanye but I like Pastor West! Got me thinking about going back to church ⛪️ 🙏🏾
God show me the way, because the Devil's trying to break me down 
😔🙏

Not today, Satan 🙌
Other rappers: girls, money, diamonds, lean

Kanye: GOD
"AHHHHHH"
*next song play*
"your my number one, you my chick fil a"
Hey man I’m crying right now. Being 42, I feel the same way about my Pops. Peace!
Go check out emmanuel.tv to see Christianity in action.  Deliverances, manifestations, healings.
This brings me so much joy. Look at how happy he looks. !!! JESUS SAVES
Kanye - Follow God and MC SMOOK WASSER are the best Music Videos this year
1:10 me by myself pretending to be a rapper
AND ARIEL DISS MAN THAT GETS HIM RAPED TO CALL HIM KING ????? IS THE QUEEN NEXT
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
The most influential 🐐
The man is a self made man.
I like this video and I live in Wyoming.
I think Kanye is a perfect fit for Wyoming.
Welcome.
I've never seen so many haters on such a dope song. That ain't christ like
He is blessed and I think the world needs him.
I've got so much respect for Kanye. During my battle with mental illness I dealt with backlash from everyone I thought loved and card for me. It wasn't until I established an unbreakable bond with God that I begin to love myself & ultimately love who love me. Kanye, I salute you bro!
#GODISQUEEN
I mean no matter how you feel about Yeezy, you've got to admit he's not predictable.
It's amazing how relationships are renewed when one is Born Again
He looks genuinely happy in this. Good he found true happiness
🙌🏼🙌🏼 he is so different and that’s what I’ve always admired about this man
He killed that song just unlike how *Epstein didnt kill himself*
Other rappers: Bentley  Lamborghinis
Kanye: 4000 acres 
a black man
"Screamin at my dad and he told me it ain't christ-like, but nobody never tell you when you bein like christ" 

Truest lyric ever told.
Bruh i love this song of kanye so much
1:08 when I’m suppose to be cleaning my room with music on
The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger, all the Messengers have (like him) passed away before him, his mother was a highly truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We explain the arguments for their good, yet see, how they are turned away (from the truth).
1:09 Me hyping myself up for a date
in my opinion .. you are the best! and for me this album is the best of 2019; I was in a bad situation and this album came to motivate me! I love you kanye glory God for your life
So proud that someone so famous could actually stand apart from the crowd and do this!!!
“Arguing with my dad and he said it ain’t Christ like”
Christianity is like soooo COOOL.. and Funn
I definitely need to put riding that Jesus tractor on my bucket list.
This song give me some otis vibes i like this new/old kanye
"it took me 42 years to realize my dad was my best friend" 

This can be taken both to mean his dad and his "father" (god)
that "repairing the relationship with your dad after 42 years" flex hits different.
