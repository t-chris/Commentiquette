this song makes me want to measure a ruler
tb to when X was blowing up. And his comments were filled with “FreeX” and not “RIPX” .


Miss you X 😢
This will forever be a legendary SoundCloud track
kinda weird that when you search up look at me nowadays this video doesn't come up, even tho it has 93m views, and this is where it was originally posted to
It’s been 4 years today since he dropped this career defining banger
“Damn son where’d you find this”

“ I found this song in Sweden, it’s pretty nice actually”
OG FANS: 0:00
NEW FANS: 0:25
I remember watching this back in 2016
This was the first x song I ever heard
Beat dropped so hard 38k people missed the like button...
I played this song to my goldfish and now he's a great white shark
Remember when it only said “prod. By Rojas”?
the thumbnail will always be legendary
The moment you realize this shit came out 5 years ago
When people said Free X instead of rip x 😔
ay
I've been trippin thinking I Mandela Effect'd the "damn son, where'd you find this." I'm glad to find it was real after all
Who’s listening to this throwback during all the corona virus activity going on
i remember the comments saying “FREE X”
18/06/19 today. 1 Year since he left us. RIP.
this song makes me want to divide by zero
Remember when the title use to be ''Rojas ft.XXXTENTACION - Look at me !'' simpler times
I showed this to my plant...




It’s weed now
Remember when the comments were like “this song make me want to ________”
This song makes me wanna give homework to my teacher
This song makes me want to put my shoes on first and then my socks
This song makes me want to call my crush and tell her she likes me
Damn this kid went to prison and converted to Islam.

Who's the kid on the cover?
Listening to this for the first time. Honest first thoughts:
It's pretty abrasive, but it's somehow still not obnoxious. It's actually a pretty sick beat and has a fun vibe. The abrasiveness works, and is not over the top. Not exactly my thing but I can respect it, for sure.
4 years...
Logan Paul after the fight be like
XXXTENTACION All of his Music is Straight Heat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2020 anyone
Back when X was a meme rapper

And 17 I thought it was super interesting music I remember remember when moonlight only had 4000 views he was so good and really no one listened or payed attention to his other songs but sad a few months later I kept listening to his music until it happened he died I remember being in the car on my way to the airport to go to Arizona with my grandma I saw my friends Snapchat story and I was in school I kept telling myself it was fake but I new it wasn’t I was almost crying but I did not wanna cry infornt of my parents and grandma it was so hard for me people may say I’m a fake fan but I don’t care what others people say that because i am only 12 and love his music

This is where I first found this on January 17th, 2016. On A Roblox Game. Thank you stranger for showing me this song.
cant ignore the fact x blew from here ...................proud asf
I remember hearing this exact song about 3 years ago when it was fresh out. I was on Roblox High School by Cindering. I was with a friend and another friend they were playing this song while we were in Club Red. I asked what the song was called and they said “Look At Me by xxxtentacion” I looked it up and liked the video. I ended up forgetting to add them both as we were in RHS for 6 hours real time. I wish I could thank them for what they had shown me. I have been listening to him ever since. Now he’s dead and now I really do want to meet them again.
I bet they were probably devastated aswell that Jahseh had died.
Anyone remember when this first can out
